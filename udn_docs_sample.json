A legacy of the WPA period is a permanent collection of 16 that hung until paintings recently in the Helper Civic Two of the pain- Auditorium. tings are by Fausett. Preservation work is being done of these paintings but they' again will be exhibited in the future. Burke is working on a project to locate and catalog all the art produced under the WPA project and to document the project. Artists in the Salt Lake area, who worked on the WPA art project included Paul Smith, Florence Ware, Barbara Moore, Dorothea Davis and others. The artists were paid $85 per month. Schools and other institutions were encouraged to buy the art work. Burke said that Miss Wares work could be purchased at that time for $2.50 per painting. The prices now paid for her work range from $500 to $2,000. Vivian Peacock Wetzel, who grew up in Price, talked about her recollections of the Depression era, when people, especialy in rural areas, developed their own talents to provide entertainment for the community. One of the first things I noted after moving to Salt Lake City in 1948 was that people there relied much more on commercial entertainment than we did here, she said. During the Depression years, and earlier, in Carbon County the schools, churches, clubs and civic organizations starting points were the for the and of plays production programs, she said. The schools produced several dramas a year and the Rotary Club sponsored one production a year in which people from the community particpated with students. The opera in produced was Carmen and earlier The Merchant 1936 Shakespeares of Venice. Harold Bithell, who should have been on Broadway and whose daughter later was on Broadway, members of the Bunnell family and many others were in these productions, she said. She also read poems written by her mother, Mabel Peacock, Bessie Gibson and other residents of this area during that time. Mrs. Wetzel also talked about her recollections of Lynn and Dean Fausett. Lynn returned to Utah after studying at the Art Students League in New York City but Dean preferred the green hills of Vermont, she said. Dean Fausett, who was much younger than Lynn, is still active as an artist. He paints by of portraits many famous people. During the Depression the movies, which have since been recognized as an art form, were our great escape, she said. also She described the 1984 fashions of the Depression era which were simple in style for featured but daytime glamourous evening gowns. She said that one ruffled evening gown worn by Joan Crawford in a movie which also featured Clark Gable was copied by a New York City department store. Hundreds of copies of this gown were sold. Wetzel received and masters Mrs. bachelors degrees from the University of Utah and a Ph.D. in education from Young Brigham She retired after children in retarded teaching the Salt Lake City school University. system. of black and white photographs of Consumers, a town no longer in existence, that were taken during the Depression era. Two photographers, Russell Lee and Dorothea Lange, who later became very famous, came to Utah, at different times, to take photographs. The photographs of Consumers, taken by Miss Lange, were to document a resettlement project, part of a government program to help miners build their own homes and to get land on which to plant gardens. It was a test project. Russell Lee did not come to Carbon County. The project apparently was not as succesful in this area as it was in agricultural parts of the . This is just one small section of the WPA mural in Price City's municipal building which was painted by Lynn Fausett during the Great Depression. The project was a means of providing work and conserving artists talents. state. Miss Lange spent only a few days photographing in Consumers Johnson said that Miss Lange was noted for photographing people, including some people of the dust bowl which became famous, but few people are shown in her photographs of Consumers. Dr. J. Eldon Dorman, who moved to Consumers only a few months after Miss Lange took her photographs, and who attended the meeting, said that the pictures, whose original prints are in the Library of Congress, depicted the worst side of Consumers. J. Grant Kilfoyle, program chairman, said future programs will include a meeting at the Helper Mining Museum; a presentation by Dr. J. Eldon Dorman, representing the Utah State Historical Society; the Castle Gate mine explosion; a walking tour of historic homes in Price, and a tour of Spring Canyon.

The two dancers have spent four weeks at the school. Lisa Roll and Lynn Koshland lead a gym class of girls at Carbon High School in a Roll and Koshland visited the school for a week in November and two weeks in December. They will finish up the residency today. Roll and Koshland worked with the students under the auspices of the Utah Arts Councils Artists in Education Program. This state program helps teachers expose students to many types of art disciplines by sharing the cost of bringing professional artists into the schools. The two have been teaching dance and choreography skills to the high School drill team and flag team members and also ' have been instructing the remaining boys and girls through physical education classes at the high school. Roll is an accomplished dancer who has performed extensively with the Tulsa Ballet, the Dallas Ballet and as a member of the Prairie Dance Theater, a modern dance company that toured as part of Arts Alliance the Program. She teaches the dynamic disciplines of movement, breath and feeling. A teacher for the Childrens Dance Theater in Salt Lake City, Roll also combines Mid-Americ- an traditional and creative movement techniques as choreographer for various dance companies. Koshland, a specialist in movement education, received her masters degree from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. She holds a bachelors degree in early childhood studies from the University of Utah. She has worked with students of all ages in movement exploration. Presently, she is a movement therapist at the Salt Lake Childrens Center, where she also teaches a conditioning class for the staff therapists. She also conducts special teacher workshops to help educators learn to relax and enjoy many types of movement. Roll says creative dance can be applied in any subject of learning and will help the students with creative decisionmaking through space, time and cooperative group efforts. Foundation analyzes unemployment compensation Is the surance in- unemployment ac- program complishing its goals and what should be the role of the program in the future? These were some of the questions asked the Foundation, by Utah private research organization, in its latest analysis of Utahs unemployment program. According to the study there has been growing concern about the program during recent years. Some critics have charged that the program has made unemployment too attractive for certain workers and firms. On the other hand, there are those who contend that the Open Daily Sunday 10-- 6 IK I him a program is too restrictive and does not serve a large group of the unemployed. Following are some of the major criticisms leveled against the program: 1. Overly generous benefits have reduced incentives to seek new employment and tend to prolong the unemployment problem. 2. Rules designed to limit benefits to those who are ready, able and willing to work are difficult to enforce. 3- .Because of cost and time considerations, employers often are discouraged from appealing the illegal granting of benefits. 4. High employment taxes have raised the cost of labor and led to greater unemployment. 5. Only about one-thi- all actually of rd unemployed persons receive unemployment benefits. 6. Availability encourages of benefits temporary unemployment because those laid off form a labor pool who can be used when needed. 7. Some individuals use unemployment benefits as a means of extending vacations and increasing leisure time. Utahs Department of Employment Security is aware of some of these problems and has placed increased emphasis on detecting fraud. According to the Foundation, a record number of fraud cases were processed in 1986. Most of these involved in dividuals who obtained unemployment benefits illegally while working or receiving other earnings. Approximately five percent of these cases were referred for criminal prosecution. Because of the concern about the program, the 1985 Congressional Budget Office report outlined a number of possible options for future consideration: 1. The waiting period before recipients would receive benefits could be extended. 2. The eligibility and enforcement requirements could be strengthened. 3.

In addition, Earl Marra, superintendent of buildings and grounds for the Carbon County School District, said the entire building shows the rather extensive and expected wear and tear from many years of intensive use. A wonderful bargain for the $2.5 million it cost, the high school has given a quarter of a century of good service and still has about 20 years of useful life remaining if it is remodeled and updated, Crocco said. In 1985 replacement costs for the high school were estimated at $16 million.

Looking at employment by major industry group, Astin indicated the following developments: During 1986, mining employment dropped by 18 percent. This sector lost 1,700 jobs over the course of the year. Utahs 1986 average of 8,000 mining jobs ranks at the lowest level of the past 35 years. Lost copper mining jobs combined with a decline in energy-relate- d extraction positions to produce this drop. Construction suffered a 2,400 job, 7 percent loss in 1986, leaving the industry with 33,100 jobs. The completion of the first phase of the Intermountain Power Project caused much of this decline. In addition, the slowdown in nonresidential y building and in dwelling construction contributed to the loss. multi-famil- In 1986, employment in dropped 2 percent (2,000 positions) to register at 92,000 jobs.

On the other hand, a few manufacturing divisions added jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing gained employment after experiencing layoffs early in the year.

Mayor Olsen told city coun-cilme- n at their Jan. meeting that Wright told him the preferred plan is to find someone interested in 8 recovering the 50 percent usable coal in the pile. Negotiations have been underway with several companies for some time. Leah Ann Schirle, water quality adminstrator, Southeastern Utah Association of Governments, said she was told that Norwest Resources Inc., a company hired by DOGM last summer to do core drilling on the pile, found that there was more good coal in the pile than formerly believed. Recovery could be done either by hauling the entire pile to a washing plant or by setting up a small mining operation on the site to try to separate the good coal from the waste materials, Schirle said. But she has been told that either process would be quite expensive, she said. If someone could be found to use the coal, only the remaining refuse would require disposal. The site being considered for disposal is on state land between the Spring Canyon and Consumer roads. Schirle said the coal pile is number two on the priority list of pollution problems on the Price River drainage. Number one is the problem surrounding Scofield Reservoir. Coal washing from the old pile into the Price River causes problems for fish and farmers, she said. The problems were particularly bad in the spring of 1983 when large amounts of water were released from Scofield Reservoir to avert flooding. Among the problems for farmers is toe fact that dark coal attracts and holds heat when it is spread over the land. For fish, coal can be life threatening because coal particles destroy protective mucous membranes. Culinary water quality is not affected by toe coal washing into the river because water for culinary use is taken out higher up toe stream. Coal piles along scenic waterways, such as the Price River, are also considered to be an eyesore by many people, she said. Present mining regulations would prohibit such piling of coal, she said. The coal apparently was believed to be of unusable quality when put there, she said, and has been there a long time. At first there were efforts to get Price River Coal Co. and then several government agencies to assume resonsibility for removal, she said. DOGM has assumed responsiblity and money has been appropriated for the project. ",

In a report released this week by fire chief David Barrett, the Price Fire Department answered 113 fire calls. Of those calls, 71 were within the city limits of Price and 39 were answered in the remainder of Carbon County. One call was answered in Hiawatha and two were answered in Wellington, according to the report. Fire losses in Price City amounted to $70,920 according to the report. The largest damage came from a fire at Road Specialists on July 18 which amounted to $20,000 in On-O- ff damage. A mobile home fire on Oct. 18 at South Carbon also caused damage. Nearly $350,000 in damage was done by fires in the county answered by the Price department. The largest fire in the county was Feb. 8 when the shops of Jensen Trucking on Ridge Road suffered $300,000 damage. A fire on March 1 at Johnson Heating in Carbonville caused $40,000 in 205 $20,000 damage. Three arson cases were investigated by the fire department in 1986, all of which were within Price City limits. The number of fire calls logged in 1986 exceeds the number of the previous three years, according to the report. The biggest cause of fires that required the fire department to respond were grass and rubbish fires that were deliberately set. The department was called to 35 such fires. Price firefighters spent over 50 hours in training during the year and received special training in arson detection, radio operations, ambulance equipment, vehicle extrication, burn treatment and braking on the fire trucks. mu ai.'w-'\" The department inspected 152 businesses for fire safety and 43 of those were found to have safety problems. Problems with fire extinguishers were the leading safety problems found, according to the report. Many in the community were reached by fire safety education provided by the department. With puppet shows and in- structional stop, and and children schools, elementary were provided along with assistance for Boy Scout merit badges. The Price Fire Department acquired the rescue truck from Carbon County in October and took over the operation of the truck. The first call that was answered by the rescue truck under the operation of the fire department was Oct. 23 when they were called to an automobile accident at the Hiawatha Junction. 1,460 adults in 81 scout groups and Demonstrations of use of fire extinguishers were presented to pre-schoo- reported people in the community.

But I am sure that it will come to that if people do not take their garbage away with them. He said the most serious problem for people who drink Scofield water is coming from human waste being left on the ice. But there is everything from human waste to food garbage, lots of beer cans, other cans, pieces of paper wrappings and cardboard packages, many things that people do not want to drink. What we want is for people to haul their garbage away, he said. There is no state agency equipped to take care of the problem for the people using the site. Palmer and the PRWID board of trustees strongly suggest that all trash materials be removed and disposed of properly in receptacles or taken home. This is a newly deVSloping problem because of the upsurge in popularity of ice fishing and changing times. from the Utah Officials Division of Wildlife Resources have expressed concern over The the pollution as well. bottom line is that if people are not going to be responsible for taking out their own trash, it will have to be closed for ice said John Livesay, fishing, division manager southeast region. the of Stavar.

Weve got a good thing going here, but we dont have the manpower to sit and watch for violators all of the time. People are just going to have to become , responsible anglers. On a positive note about the lake, fisheries manager Walt Donaldson indicated that there have been new parking areas on the east side of the reservoir created by the Utah Department of Transportation, relieving much of the parking pressure along the highway. Signs indicating heavy pressure along the road have also been put up. In the past, winter was a time when old fishermen talked, about their mighty catches and the big ones that got away during the summer. For the past several years Scofield has been one of the best places in the state for ice fishing and other forms of winter recreation such as riding three vehicles. and Many people are coming from other parts of the state. For many it is a great family outing through the use of mobile homes and campers. Some even pitch tents on the ice. The trustees of the water four-wheel- ed district said that it' is a great opportunity to have such a fine recreational site within easy access and they want to encourage its use to the fullest. We hope that people will become concerned with the problem and will begin leaving only footprints and tire tracks behind when they leave, they said.

Riding in his first bicycle race three years ago at the Carbon County Fairgrounds opened a new world to him the world of bike racing or BMX. The fascination of the sport is the challenge of trying to take fast-pac- ed each obstacle and each jump better and faster, he said. Since that first race, he has entered every race possible, including four in Provo. He won first place in each of the Provo races he entered. Races there are held in Edgemont Park. He practices riding an hour or two each day, often in the surrounding hills. Cory said he hopes that more races will be held in the Carbon County area in the future.

Bangerters 198788 budget proposal received a hearty endorsement from the Utah State Board of Regents on Friday, and regents vowed to do everything they could to ensure its passage by the Legislature. Governor Bangerter has taken a farsighted and courageous education approach to the and economic challenges facing our state, said Wm. Rolfe Kerr, commissioner of higher education, in suggesting the regent endorsement. He proposes that we invest in the future of this state by investing in education. We admire the fact that he has done his homework and made this responsible recommendation to the Legislature. Regents agreed that the governors budget proposal will be difficult to achieve because of the necessary tax increases, but they said it is the minimum investment necessary. The budget request submitted by the regents is several million dollars larger then the governors. Legislators and citizens must understand that a tax increase now can yield enormous rewards in the future, a regent resolution said. The governor has shown visionary leadership by the educational signaling alert, said regent chairman Sue Marie Young. We can slip back into mediocrity or, if we the support governors proposal, we can move forward into excellence. Regent Steven E. Snow, a St. prominent George Democrat, said his support for the governors proposal is not diminished by the fact that their politics are different. This is not a partisan issue. It is a bipartisan crisis, Snow said. I applaud the governor for his political courage and his commitment to education. We need to have an active campaign for the governors budget and Democrats by Republicans. Kerr, too, praised the governor as a real statesman. His budget proposal is CASTLE DALE David A. scheduled preliminary for hearing in Eleventh Circuit Court Thursday, entered a guilty plea to a reduced charge of attempting to provide contraband to a person in custody, a class A misdemeanor. The charges derive from an incident where sheriffs deputies allege Martinez brought marijuana into the Emery County Detention Center whilejServing weekend time at the jail on a spouse abuse charge. Martinez attorney Marlynn Lema asked for a sentencing hearing. She said substance abuse therapy had been advised for Martinez. Judge A. John Ruggeri ordered the hearing for Feb. 19. Preliminary hearing or disposition was scheduled for Feb. 19 for Michael D. Davis, 23, Castle Dale, charged with third degree felony theft of truck parts valued at more than $250 and less than $1000. Trial before a jury of six was scheduled for May 19, to hear charges of possession of protected wildlife, a bear, a class A misdemeanor, against Ruland Hooley, 35, Huntington. Dennis Gunn, 39, Sandy, was charged with DUI, open container, interfering with arrest and assault against a peace officer. He failed to appear in court. Judge Ruggeri ordered Price Bail Bond to produce him by Feb. 5 or forfeit bail of $1000. Willard W. Hilliard, 63, Huntington, was sentenced to pay $598 in fines plus 25 percent in legislative assessments for driving on suspension and interfering with an officer. Hilliard, whose license was revoked after being involved in an accident, was also ordered to serve six months in the Emery County Detention Center, with five months suspended. He is to receive alcohol therapy while on probation. He is to start his sentence Jan. 16 and therapy immediately upon his release from jail. He was ordered not to drive until he was properly licensed. Homero Gonzales, 20, Green River, was in court on a repeated charge of assault spouse abuse. The earlier assault charge had been dropped and a charge of possession of an alcoholic beverage by a person under 21, was pending. He pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to serve two months in the Emery County Detention Center and will receive therapy while in jail.

Governor Bangerter has taken a farsighted and approach to the education and economic challenges facing our state, said Wm. Rolfe Kerr, commissioner of higher education, in suggesting the regent encourageous visionary leadership by the educational signaling alert, said regent chairman Sue Marie Young. We can slip back into mediocrity or, if we proposal, we can move forward into excellence. Regent Steven E. Snow, a St. prominent George Democrat, said his support for the governors proposal is not diminished by the fact that their politics are different. This is not a partisan issue. It is a bipartisan crisis, Snow said. I applaud the governor for his political courage and his commitment to education. We need to have an active campaign for the governors budget dorsement. He proposes that we invest in the future of this state by investing in education. We admire the fact that he has done his homework and made the governors support this by responsible recommendation to Democrats and Republicans. Kerr, too, praised the governor as a real statesman. the Legislature. Regents agreed that the governors budget proposal will be difficult to achieve because of the necessary tax increases, but they said it is the minimum investment necessary. The budget request submitted by the regents is several million dollars larger then the governors. Legislators and citizens must understand that a tax increase now can yield enormous rewards in the future, a regent resolution said.

To halt that erosion, he has recommended significant pay raises. Members of Congress, for example, would make $89,500; Cabinet officers, $99,500; appeals court judges, $95,000. Good work if you can get it. Those who cant might be interested in the fact that the minimum wage is still $3.35 an hour. It has been $3.35 an hour in the six years Ronald Reagan has been president. That works out to $134 for a week. issue with last the minimum-wag- e dealt Congress in 1977, when it passed a series of four increases, the last of which took effect on Jan. 1, 1981. Meanwhile, the cost of living has risen 20 percent. A person year-roun- d at $3.35 an hour will working The level for a family of three earn $6,968. poverty in was $8,573 1985, the latest year for which figures 40-ho- ur full-tim- e, are available. And yes, there are families, many of them, that are affected by the minimum wage. They fall into the category of the working poor. They work, because to being on welfare. They they prefer know the minimum wage; they know something about substantial erosion as well. cy Our tab $1 .024.000,000,000 One of those silver-foote- ironies d that periodically skip across the political stage did so again when the most conservative president in recent budget. history proposed our first trillion-dollThe man who in years past took to the airwaves and circuit to taunt trillion-dolla- r the after-dinnDemocrats finds himself with a $1,024 trillion budget of his own. Its a budget that would sustain his defense buildup, curtail many domestic programs and rule out any general tax increase; its also a budget that will bear only passing resemblance to the version ar er Congress will craft later in the year. In past years, President Reagans proposed budget has been more an ideological statement of principle than a realistic plan for parceling out the public purse. This year, recognizing deficit and Democrat realities, the presidents proposal at least provides a starting point for partisan wrangling over spending priorities. One of the toughest battles will involve defense spending. With the presidents proposed 3 percent increase, defense spending would grow by $20 billion a year over the next five years. Even though thats the smallest increase this administration has yet asked for, we doubt that Congress will go along. Under the leadership of Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who becomes Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, lawmakers will be questioning defense priorities and looking for a less costly, though just as effective, overall mosaic. Its a useful quest. Money for the presidents Strategic Defense Initiative will be subject to careful scrutiny. Included in the proposed outlay for the coming fiscal year is another $5.34 billion, a sizable increase over the $3.23 billion allocated for fiscal 1987. Congress started cutting on SDI in this fiscal years budget; Star Wars in the coming year is likely to become Star Skirmish. A dangerous deficit cloud shadows all of these budgetary considerations, we realize. Its a cloud that should be dispelled by further cuts. No respect for ignorance There is no cure for AIDS. There is only prevention. Doctors once spoke of high-ris- k groups. They now high-ris- k of behaviors. They once called it an speak outbreak. Then it was called an epidemic. Now it is threatening to become pandemic. AIDS is breaking out of the gay and drug community and into the general community. It now threatens anyone who is exposed to the virus through blood or sexual practice. Scientists are working on a cure for AIDS and a vaccine against it. But researchers say they are at least five years away from either. What can we do now to prevent millions of people from being exposed to AIDS? California state Sen. Gary K. Hart has proposed urgent legislation requiring California public school junior and senior high students to learn about AIDS and how not to get it. The first step would be to purchase existing AIDS education videotapes and distribute them to the public schools. The second step would be to set up a program geared to students. Why do teenagers need to know about AIDS? Because they are coming of age in an era of sexual danger unprecedented in modern times. Groups, such as the many in Utah, that are concerned about the moral impact of education on youth not know Wheft of the kids should weigh danger letting mortal danger they may face. Many junior and senior high school students are sexually active. A number use intravenous drugs. People with the deadly AIDS virus often dont know and can infect others. The best they are infected way to prevent AIDS from spreading like wildfire among young people is for students to say No to sex and No to drugs Yes to health. AIDS is 100 percent fatal. The threat of death is a powerful inducement if they are for teens to remain virgins and drug-fre- e told the facts. AIDS-preventi- chucks waggin When the lights go out in Utah Heres another quote from the Declaration By CH.UCKZEHNDER Managing editor . . But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them (the people) under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their DUTY (emphasis, mine), to throw off such Government, and to provide new guards for of Independence: Starting Friday we will run the exact wording of the Constitution of the United States over the next few weeks. Please note the sponsors of this they are helping you to be truly informed. , Last week we ran the Declaration of Independence in its entirety so you can see which is full circle how far we have come in many areas. First of all, there are taxes. Normie wants to really stick it to all of us (well, not all only those with small or no families ) . One of the reasons for the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence was For imposing Taxes on us . without our Consent. Ask your state legislator if he thinks all tax increases ought to happen by referendum (placed on the ballot for the people to decide). One of the reasons for revolt over 200 years ago was that legislators raised taxes continually without letting the people make the decision. Another quote from the Declaration of Independence: He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance. Talk about a multitude of offices and officers just in the Salt Lake City telephone directory, there are about 1,200 telephone listings for state government offices. But whats really scary is when you count up all of the listings in that directory for city, county, state and federal government therere about 3,000 listings telephones and thats just in Salt Lake City alone. Now the Utah Legislature wants to make it even worse they want more money to support all of these offices and officers in the manner to which they have become accustomed. No regard for the people of the state who must pay for this. Talk about despotism. their future security. It was interesting to see two stories in The Salt Lake Tribune over the weekend. One story, in Saturdays paper on the front page, headlined an article, Lawmakers See Tax Hike, But How Much? Another story, on page B1 in Sundays paper, headlined this article on the jump inside, More Folks Leaving Utah Than Arriving, But Its Hard to Say Why. Our legislators need to see the connection. Our governor said in his State of the State message Monday night that he wants to see economic development and industry come to this state. Ill guarantee no industry is going to come to a state where the per capita income is about the lowest in the nation and the burden of taxes is one of the very highest no matter how good the schools are. Normie wants the legislators to become responsible and I couldnt agree more. Unfortunately, Normie thinks that I responsibility means to hike taxes believe it is to reduce goldbricking state offices and officers. Its our duty to throw off a government which is not responsive to the people and when it was done before, it caused a revolution. Utah officials do some pretty absurd things with your tax money and make some pretty absurd observations. The show business people in Salt Lake City on television showed us, with apparent pride, the big pumping engine heading for the west desert. Only in Utah could this happen. Think about it for a minute. Utah, the second most arid state in the on nation, is going to spend millions and millions of tax dollars to pump water out into the desert west of the Great Salt Lake so it can evaporate. Then the lake effect will bring about more condensation and we will get more rain. Officials in other areas of the country who have a problem with shortages of water would spend that money to build dams and diversion structures in the mountains to save the water and use it later in the year but not Utah. And who is going to pay to prevent the property damage around the Great Salt Lake? Why, people in Carbon County and San Juan and Emery and Garfield and Wayne, ad infinitum. Does that make sense to you? And the governor told us Monday night that state unemployment is below the national average. I can tell you, and so can hundreds of unemployed miners, steel workers and copper workers, that it isnt because of all the jobs available. Notice the story on page one about the state of Utahs economy and notice that state government jobs increased in 1986 by 5.5 percent. All other employment in Utah went up by only 1.7 percent. So why Is unemployment down? More Folks Are Leaving Utah Than Arriving, the headline said in the Sunday Salt Lake Tribune. Utah has lapsed into an pattern in the last three years, with some 17,000 Utahns moving to other states, for one eason or another, reporter Dan Bates said in the article. With 17,000 people leaving the state and very few coming in, you would think the state would be dropping in population, but not so. Utahs high birthhrate is still keeping the states overall population growing. But the recent is considered one factor in slowing the rate. During the 1970s, Utahns, counting both newborns and new residents, expanded at an average rate of 3.3 percent a year. Utahs annual population-growt- h rate today is down to 1.3 percent, Bates continued. One conclusion that can be drawn from this is that Utah is reverting back to larger families because the smaller families are leaving. But that is alarming for the smaller families who remain in Utah. The governor wants to double the deductions for children and that would mean much more than doubling the tax burden for those who choose to not tax the system in Utah by having small or no families. Normie wants the Legislature to come to grips with the problem and do something about it. Only he thinks, like most politicians, that coming to grips with any problem is simply to throw more money at it. Its time for the governor and the Legislature to do something more than just exact higher taxes on the people. On the street what these guy are doing is its called racketeering. illegal Please talk to your legislators and make them come to grips with the unique problems that are Utahs before it is too , on late. ...And eer pregnancy could be reduced dramatically our society wasn't too embarrassed to talk about you know what with you know who before they end up you Know how. ' - - One of the signs held up by the tax hike protesters on the steps of the Capitol Monday said, Will the last person to leave Utah, please turn out the lights? I think theyre already out on Capitol Hill. ",

At this point the Dons quickly inbounded the ball to their sophomore sensation, Randy Reid, and the youngster drove the length of the court to draw a foul on his errant shot. Reid calmly went to the line and dropped in his 10th and 11th successful free throws of the game to give his team a 6 lead. This only set the stage for Revas heroics.

Carbon connected on a total of six Revas getting four, and Tom Bill Johnson and Marcellous Cowper one each.

Janeal Pabst was the scoring leader in the game for the Lady Dinos with 14 points while Kari Jennings was next in line with 10 points, including two three-poishots that came in at an important point in the game. Even though Pabst was the scoring leader, Kohlmeier said Jennings was the strong player for the team in the game. She had to play at defensive forward, a position new to her and when the Dinos were down by 10, she put in the two that drew it up to a game at one point. I think we had the to get close to them, but not enough to beat them, just Kolmeier said. At the end of the first quarter, the Colorado team had only a three point edge over the Carbon ladies. Scoring was exactly the opposite in the Carbon Highs Lady Dino cage squad suffered a loss in their last game of the season Saturday night at the hands of the visiting Grand Junction High team. The visitors from Colorado returned to the Centennial State with a 3 win from the Lady Dinos, just days before the Carbon team opened the Region Eight season with a road trip to Springville Tuesday. The loss, however, wasnt a hard one to take for coach Gary Kohlmeier. He said that the Grand Junction team has been picked to win their region on the western slope of Colorado. Three things, added together, led to the demise, Kohlmeier said. First, the Lady Dinos didnt make shots that they could have. The second factor was that they got tired in the fourth quarter and that hurt them on defense, while the third factor was that they let down on Janeal Pabst and a Grand Junction Lady Tiger race to recover a loose ball in Saturday's game.

Grand Junctions best scoring frame came in the third quarter when they poured in 20 points while the Lady Dinos werent far behind with 17. The sluggish fourth quarter on the part of the Carbon team is where the wider span in the final score came from. Grand Junction added another 17 points to their score while Carbon managed 11. Kohlmeier said he was pleased with the defensive unit on the team as they handled Grand Junctions press and fast break pretty well. Carbon started their Region Eight season Tuesday at Springville.

Parental leave is an employee benefit that would allow mothers and fathers to be absent from work because of the birth, adoption or serious illness of a child, with assurance that their jobs will be available when they return to work. To inform people in this area about the need for and benefits of parental leave for employees, the Lady Miners of Utah will sponsor a workshop Saturday beginning, at 9:30 a.m. in the UMWA district headquarters, by 525 East 100 South. Rose Hurtado, coordinator for parental leave for the Lady Miners and other officers of the group including Rita Miller, president, are planning the workshop. On the program will be June Rostan and Cosby Totten, representatives of the Coal Employment Project which has headquarters in Dumfries, Va. (near Washington, D.C.) and Oak Ridge, Tenn. Rostan and Totten have conducted similar workshops in several other places.

Every industrial nation and many developing countries guarantee a woman the following rights: leave from employment for childbirth, job protection while she is on leave and a cash benefit to replace all or most of her earnings. In Western Europe, the average maternity leave is five months at full pay. On the other side of the coin, Douglas Pike, a columnist for the Orlando Sentinel whose column is widely reprinted in other papers said in October of last year: The current law, passed in 1978, requires that pregnancy be treated the same as any other medical condition that idles an employee. If a job includes disability benefits, they must cover you in case of a blessed event or a cursed concussion. He said the rub is that about of all U.S. workers have no disability protection. Basically, the Schroeder bill one-thi- rd the in (introduced last bill.

Being unpaid, all these leaves have a glow, but in fact the bill imposes costs, Pike said. It may well be a hardship for a business with 20 or so workers and modest profits to hold open a particular job for four months or to create an equivalent one after that time job-righ- ts ks two-ye- ar no-co- st off. There are economic reasons this general rule: The smaller the business, the less generous the benefits, he said. He went on to say that for Washington has far more reason for protecting workers who become disabled than those who become parents because many households have only one breadwinner. His view is that a heart attack creates a greater financial and more instantaneous crisis than becoming a parent. Pike said that where Schroeders bill really went haywire was in concocting equal leave for both mothers and fathers. A growing minority of men are interested in sharing the childs first few months but the fathers urge to stay home is personal preference, unlike a womans physical, disability with childbirth, Pike said. The time off might be handy for all sorts of things non-option- traveling, getting al married, electroshock undergoing therapy, but should be arranged for the convenience of the business, he concluded. But in Massachusetts where state laws currently entitle a new mother, whether natural or adoptive, to an unpaid leave of up to eight weeks, there have been proposals to allow up to 16 weeks leave for either perhaps some salary compensation as well. It is unthinkable that fathers should not have time with their baby if they so desire, Robert Gray, a mens parent and activist rights from Framingham, Mass., was quoted as saying in the Brookline Tab in their Oct. 14, 1986 issue. The push for a parenting bill attracted the attention of Gov. Michael Dukakis. Last year he appointed eight people to serve on a special commission relative to promoting parenting leave. Lorretta Harrigan, manager employer services for the Associated Industries of Massachusetts and a member of the commission, said she is against state regulation of parenting leave, but favors of individual g companies their own program to meet the specific needs of employees. tailor-makin- Massachusetts state Mary Jane representative, Gibson said, As more women flood the work force and continue to have children... businesses will have to realize... working and child rearing cannot be done by the mother alone.

Another problem is that some of the variable interest home equity loans based on the prime lending rate have no upper limit. While the interest rate may seem low now, it was only about six years ago that the prime rate was 21 percent, the consumer economist said. Foreclosure is a possibility, but more likely, the consumer would choose the option of paying only the interest on the loan and then refinancing a balloon payment when the term of the loan is up. This could lead to a perpetual cycle of debt. The obvious risk of any type of loan is losing your collateral. In this case, the collateral is your home. This is possibly a riskier and more stressful Radial Arm Saw dub notes V4-- n. Regular 149.99 Thru January 24 Cleans up liquid or dry spills. tfkrt Quantities fnQ yvO Limited box powder.

These include rules relating to small mine operators. After considering comments received to date, the board and division believe there are problems with the proposed rules, some of which result from problems in the Utah Mined all-da- toU-fr- 528-615- 4. ee Land Reclamation Act.

One young girl wrote about a rag doll made for her by the great aunt who became her mother for a few years after her real mom left the family. She also wrote of her desire for a real family and her intention never to leave the children she hopes to have some day. A young boy wrote of a cherished photograph of his young brother killed in an accident and his hope of eternal life where his family can live together forever. Another youngster wrote about a photograph of his absent father, whom he had not known for much of his life. The old photograph of his father as a child was received by the writer following a meeting with his father in another state. When I feel sad or lonely, I look at the sweet face in the photograph and feel as though everything will be all right, the writer said. I forget about the bad times when I felt unloved and realize that I have a father who cares for me and who is also a lifelong best friend. Taylor said that with the trend in the Carbon County School District of teaching English through writing, that the students have had several other writing experiences, including the writing of movie reviews. A unit on story telling and how to write a personal history was taught by Susan Brown, a student teacher from Brigham Young University. Soon the students in the class will go to elementary schools to teach the same thing, Taylor said. Taylor said that many of the students in the honors English class are involved in other activities. They have had to learn to make commitments and choices. Wendy Van Wagoner said that she has already had to make some difficult choices because of her busy schedule. Tayor said that sometimes students figure out how to get an A from a class and that is as much as they will do.

We' will switch to pumping nitrogen (into the mine) when the carbon dioxide no longer lowers the carbon monoxide levels, 5 i he said. Henrie said there were both advantages and disadvantages to using nitrogen. Im told that nitrogen has the same atomic weight as carbon monoxide so it should mix more easily, but it does cost three to four times as much as carbon dioxide. The standard which is trying to be reached in lowering the Parbon monoxide levels, about 1,000 parts per million, Henrie said. ' He said that everyone in Put menial home By ARVA SMITH writer Staff The proposed building of a home for chronically ill mental patients on a corner of the old Carbon Hospital grounds was protested Monday night at the regular meeting of the Price Planning and Zoning Commission. A petition with signatures of residents of the surrounding area was - presented to the commission by Earlene Gibson, who lives near the proposed site. The petition will be forwarded to the city council for consideration at their meeting Wednesday night, Jon Anast, planning and zoning com-- : mission chairman, said. He pointed out that the the planning and zoning com- mission is an advisory group charged only with making recommendations to the city council. The planning and : zoning group does not make final decisions, nor did they make a recommendation in this matter. At the beginning of the meeting James H. Whear, executive director of Four 470 f . : ; I v Corners Mental. Health, presented an outline of plans for the proposed building on a 155 x 125 foot lot located on the comer of 1st East and 6thNorth. The lot would be purchased from Carbon County and Price City, joint owners of the property, at premium prices, he said. The county and city will not sell the property at less than market value, he said. Whear, who is also president of the Eastern Utah Mental Health Service, Inc., a nonprofit corporation that would seek a loan for the building from HUD (Housing and Urban Development), said the facility would be residential rather than for treatment. The housing unit would be for people already living in the community who are residing in substandard housing or who are living in a stressful family situation, he said. One of tiie advantages of group housing would be increased ability to monitor the mental patients to make sure are no more likely to provoke unpleasant incidents than are people in the general population. Following Whears presentation the meeting was opened for people attending to make comments or ask questions. Aaron Hanson, an area resident, said that the people who would be residing in the home are not fully responsible for their actions and that they are receiving proper dangerous incidents could oe- -' medication, he said.

Also attending the meeting was Louise Tatton, another concerned area resident, who said her views had already been expressed by other speakers. Regarding other proposed sites, Whear said that some of the them do not meet regulations set forth by HUD. The rules imposed by HUD state that the housing must be built within one mile of shopping, and that the area must not have an excessive amount of noise. The old hospital property is borderline as far as being near enough to shopping in -- the job of diluting the carbon monoxide, there could be teams in the mine early on Wednesday morning. Pumping of the carbon dioxide was discontinued earlier when the atmospheric pressure dropped i lower., than the lair pressure inside the mine. That change in pressure caused some of the seals to begin leaking late stallations, he said. One proposed site for the building, the Carbon County Industrial Park is too far from shopping. Another site on the south side of Price is too near the railroad tracks, he said. A loan would be sought from HUD to buy property and build the building through a guaranteed mortgage. People living in the building would pay rent, Whear said. The people who would live in the building have income, some from social security disability payments, Whear said. During the question and answer portion of the meeting, Jim Bowman said there are no last week and caused the heavier carbon dioxide to seek out lower levels inside the mine, Henrie said. Although no press will be allowed at the scene during the breaching of the seals, there will be a photographer from Utah Power and Light who will make of the reentry photographs to the available operation media, Henrie said.

Anast explained that it could not be expanded without going through the same steps that are needed before the original building is built. Anast also invited the people at the meeting protesting the site, to invite those who feel the same way to attend the city council meeting Wednesday night.

DAVIS Progress editor Utah Power and Light officials announced Monday that a coal contract with Coastal States Coal Company of Salina will not be consummated due to an inefficiency of the coal to burn adequately at the Hunter Plant. Serfustini, a spokesman for UP&L, said in referring to the coal which the company has been testing for several weeks, The cost of the inefficiency of the coal was ' greater than the savings we could have gotten by the sale. Coastal States was one of eight mines in Utah named by UP&L as recipients of contracts to supply coal to the Hunter Plant.

Mines receiving contracts and which are now producing coal Tor Hunter are Consolidation Coal Co., Perma Genwal, Getty, Corp., Tower Resources, and Soldier Creek. Coastal States was given a contract pending the outcome of test bums which were completed last week. Serfustini said that although Coastal States will not be granted a contract, no other bids are being sought at this time.

Stockman was testifying before the Senate Budget Committee in defense of President Reagans $974 billion budget proposal for fiscal 1986. But his defense wore thin in some areas and his own personal views appeared. He virtually invited Congress to take some cuts in the administrations program for military spending, pointing out that it has appropriated $1.2 trillion for defense over the past five years 95 percent of what was asked. Speaking of the high cost of military pensions, Stockman said: Its an outrage. The institutional forces of the military are more concerned about protecting their retirement benefits than they are about protecting the security of the American 1 , people. made Then, when Sen. Robert Hasten, demands for aid to financially troubled farmers, Stockman replied: For the life of me, I cannot figure out why the taxpayers of this country have the responsibility to go in and refinance bad debt that was willingly incurred by consenting adults who went out and bought far- inland when the price was going up and they thought they could get rich. Stockman said the administration probably will cave in and produce an emergency farm credit lawmakers program because if it doesnt, farm-stat- e wont allow reforms in farm subsidy programs. We say, Right on! to Stockmans opinions on military retirement and farm bailouts. There should be higher pay scales for the active military and reduced pensions for the retired military. Those who join the armed forces with a fat pension as their goal are not the kind of service personnel this nation needs. R-Wi- s., A needle in the j'ustice haystack th period.

One of the two Los Angleles doctors was paid $342,595; the other received $218,589. For nine months work, thats pretty good income, even for a physician.

We appreciate the efforts he makes to help our individual students realize the importance to be gained by being ladies and gentlemen and to hold them responsible for their actions, good and bad. Of course, their best actions and performances result in their being able to bring back to Carbon High and the community many trophies and awards. But, more important than the reward is the realization that they are a very special group of people. The pride they have in feeling that they do a great job and that they are special is something that will provide them with confidence as they face their future in the real world.

Self-Adjusti- ng Lifestyles of the poor By MICHAEL DAME Staff writer . During Christmas Eve in 1912, my father was born in a one room log cabin with an oilcloth ceiling in the small community of Meadow, Utah. Through hard work, my father eventually became an accountant. By the time I was born, my family was middle class. But I sometimes wonder if the rise from poverty to middle class ever took hold of me. It seems my pockets are always lacking the melodious sound of coins jingling merrily around. How I got into this condition, Ill never know. My wife says poverty with some people is just a bad habit, and rides. Some people have the Midas touch. Everything I touch turns to junk. Needless to say, my wife wont let me drive her new Im one of them. For instance, I own two cars and a truck. None of them run. Henry David Thoreau said if you give a poor man who owns a shack a dozen more shacks, he is 12 times as poor. How true. Poverty may be a mystery to those of us who are poor, but to my wife, who comes from an upper middle class area near . -- $3) Washington D.C., it is perfectly explainable. If you cant go first class, you charge it; if you have the money to buy a car, you spend it on movies and restaurants instead, she says. My wife and I have had separate credit and bank accounts for years. After ten years of putting up with my junkers and other fleamarket trash, last week she drove up in a new car. Dont ask me how I got it, how much it cost or how much the payments are and maybe Ill give you a ride once in a while, she told me.

I hooked everything up except the drive shaft. It was then that I discovered that the tail shaft of the transmission was too long, meaning I cant drive the car. No problem, the transmission place said. Well just shorten the drive shaft for $50. It seems Im always getting shafted. To her, how some people stay poor can be explained in great detail.

Strate said that other reasons why the county is seeking a diversion is to avoid having the alleged victims testify in a trial because of the impact it would have on them. Furthermore, he said that it would be difficult for the county to prove ciminal intent on the part of the defendant with the available defendants arraignment This order upon stipulation of the parties shall not act as a bar of double jeopardy against the state to bring any further charges against the defendant if . new information comes to life. As part of the investigation, the county attorneys office turned over all evidence ac- cumulated by that office to the court Strate said that the Judge evidence. in- vestigation could produce new evidence, or the judge may rule that a diversion is inappropriate for such a procedure and the defendant will then be required to enter a plea. He added that pending the outcome of the investigation, charges may be changed. He emphasized that the conditions of the diversion are also likely to be changed. After hearing Strates motion requesting a diversion, Judge ;Keller asked Olsens attorney, Michael Jensen, joined with the motion adseeking a to also and justment agreed the conditions as outlined by Strate. He said that should the matter go to trial, things would get worse and worse for the alleged victims and the defendant. However, Jensen said that if the conditions are changed by the court, he reserves the right, on behalf of his client, to withdraw from the motion. The defendant was also asked during the hearing if he would agree to wave his right to a speedy trial and to cooperate fully with the investigation, and Olsen agreed. He also said that he fully understood the charges against him and his rights to a non-judici- the deputy county attorney how such action would ;compare to a criminal sentence. Strate said that a psychological devaluation of the defendant by Dr. Scoresby indicated that Olsen is not guilty although therapy is needed. Strate also said that the psychologist al trial. Earlier in the procedure, the judge ruled on an application filed by Castle Dale attorney Allen Thorpe, requesting that he be allowed to appear Amicus Curiae or as a friend of the court on behalf of the families of the alleged victims. ' Although the judge granted the request, he placed, some r . restrictions on Thorpes function, saying he should serve only as a liaison between' the victims and the court and .that he may not participate in argument or make motions, or introduce evidence although he was requested to .submit any evidence he acquires to the county attorneys office. He is also allowed to attend all hearings, even closed hearings, in the case. The judge told the attorneys that he will issue a more defined ruling on Thorpes role as amicus curiae in the future. Both Strait and Jensen opposed the application for amicus curiae. Strait questioned Thorpes right to see certain confidential evidence as well as his right to having standing on court procedure. 1 Prisoner attempts suicide CASTLE DALE A license plates on the vehicle. The suspect was later identified as an escapee from the Lake Hills Halfway House in Salt Lake City. Andrus was brought to the Emery County Detention Center in Castle Dale where he was arraigned on the theft charges. According to Captain Owens, at about 2 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 6, jailer Lyle Snow found Andrus sitting on the floor of his cell with a bed sheet wrapped around his neck. He said that Andrus lips were blue and he was unconscious. Andrus was then taken to Castleview Hospital in Price Utah . rison escapee, who was tarrested in Emery County last tweek and who apparently to hang himself in the detention center, has county been returned to the state (facility.

Strate said that the conditions are subject to change, pending the outcome . of the investigation, and Jensen pointed out that Thorpes request threatened the defendants job and livelihood, saying if he is not allowed to work in the district, the defendant may opt to withdraw from the diversion motion and seek a full trial. However, Judge Keller said that he was not granting a diversion at the arraignment but would review the matter on March 18 along with ind formation acquired in the court-directe- investigation. MERTS Ms those involved is considered in determining sentencing. Thorpe also opposed a motion by Jensen, which was sanctioned by Strate, to exclude all spectators from the arraignment. Pointing out that the hearing was an adult proceding, not a juvenile matter, Thorpe said the public has a right to know fact from rumor.

The captain surmised that Andrus had become despondent about the additional felony charges facing him while in the county jail.

The Dost Deal in Town $, Your Price For HERES WHAT YOU RECEIVE: BULL'S Jensen also protested and based his argument on legal precedent which he summarized in three Utah court cases dealing with amicus curiae. He said that granting Thorpe standing borders on usurping the authority of the county attorney who has exin such clusive authority matters, and that amicus curiae is usually only granted in civil matters, not criminal. Thorpe said that while he had no new evidence to submit to the court, he said his role is to represent the families of the alleged victims and to safeguard their privacy. He also said he wants to make sure the families rights are favored by the law in the course of the hearings and that the effect the alleged crimes have had on the where he was released to the custody of sheriffs deputies Wednesday afternoon.

About 30 people were present to view the procedings. After gaining limited standing in the hearing, Thorpe protested one proposed condition outlined in the diversion motion which would allow Olsen to continue teaching in the school district. If he is allowed back in the classroom the implication is that that there was no valid claim, Thorpe said. There is also the implication that the alleged victims did something wrong.

Brand renewal is required The Utah Department of Agriculture has announced that brand renewal notices have been mailed out to all those who registered their brands andor marks in 1980 or in the five ensuing years. They are asking people who have brands andor marks registered to notify them if they have not received their renewal notice. The brand renewals are due back to the Department of Agriculture by June 1, with the ten dollar fee. Brands not renewed will expire as of Dec. 31, and then they can be registered to anyone who ap n n IL Shoe H plies, added Dr. Poulson. Once the fee and renewal is received and processed the owner will be issued a certificate which will contain the brand andor mark symbols and locations for their records and proof of registration. an animals said Dr. Robert Poulson, bureau chief for animal identification of the of Utah Department Agriculture.

The computer capabilities enables symbols and numbers to be matched and printed out to the rightful owner. This technology not only saves considerable amounts of time and manpower, it reduces possibilities of human error when 19,000 stamps are transferred by hand to records, certificates and the brand book. An example Of the cost savings is the lack of need to hire twelve additional people for three weeks. The 27,000 notices were printed and ready to be mailed in one days time. The computer has really streamlined our operation, said Dr. Poulson. With the computer we can tell which brands are available and which arent and what positions are available. Probably the most important use will be in the ability to track animals and find the rightful owner. According to Dr. Poulson, Utah is the first western ststa to computerize and other stsioi are watching to see how Utahs system works.

Wellington Elementary School Principal Ralph Dyet and Helper Junior High School Principal Boyd Bell made presentations to the Carbon CouhtylSSchdol Board at; a. fhegtinglSSt Thursday. ' Dyet presented overlays progress in several different academic areas for his students from the 1983-8- 4 school year. The statistics compared showing students at Wellington Elementary to other students of and the same age district-wid- e also nationwide. The statistics presented by Dyet show that with the exception of one grade, students at Wellington Elementary are higher than the national average in most subjects and higher than the district-wid- e average in many areas. The only group that was than significantly lower average was the 1983-8- 4 fourth grade, a group that is currently in the fifth grade. The group is below both the district and national averages in nearly every subject except math. Dyet said there were several reasons for that. One factor is the class size, Dyet said. Another factor is that they are lower in reading. Its hard to pass an achievement test if you cant read well. I also feel some of the students from that group should be retained, but the parents have refused, he continued. Dyet said teachers and administrators are working with the students and would continue to try to help them make more progress in the future. In response to a question about how well he liked the new school building put into use last fall, Dyet said while there were a few bugs with it, he was satisfied. Were real happy with the building, he said. We have 535 kids there right now. Dyet said there was a major problem with parking when the school holds functions to which family members are invited. Another problem he identified for board members is a problem of students arriving very early 'I have a solution to the problem. Let me start school at 8 a.m. and: have those When a student fall. Bell also had praise for the assertive discipline program saying ... one of the better things we have done is our assertive discipline plan. Our teachers bought into the program early and have supported it, be continued.

I have a solution to the outside school hours. Helpers Boyd Bell said he has the same problem at his school and has had to assign teachers to hall duty to maintain order there. always nothings written in stone, but the rescheduling of bus routes does entail great complexity, Sorenson said. He urged Dyet to get with Elementary Supervisor Jim Jensen and bus supervisor Bill Gentry to go over the schedule and see what can be done to solve the Wellington problem. Dyet also said he was concerned about students being based program which program realm. education requires teaching to mastery before a student is advanced and said he believes it is a very good problem. Let me start school at 8 a.m. and have those buses come back and pick them up at 2:30 p.m., he said. In response to a question from a board member about whether the parents of the school children would be upset with such a proposal, Dyet said he didnt believe they would. Carbon County School District Superintendent Ell Sorenson said there could be problems with double routing in the district if die buses were sent to Wellington to pick up students at 2:30 p.m. He wondered whether the buses would be able to deliver die students home and make it back to Carbon High School in time to pick up students there. Sorenson also said other schools in the district were experiencing the same problem of having students in schools for significant periods of time outcome .f program. . He also had praise for the assertive district-wid- e discipline program. But he said it has its limitations. It works very well in the classroom with the teachers, he said. But it doesnt work quite as well in the halls, in the lavatories and But the on it playground. works fairly well. Also making a presentation to the board overall, at Thursdays meeting was Helper Junior High Principal Boyd Bell who said he sees some very positve things at his school and a few negative ones as well. On the positive side, I feel that the students are happy, Bell said. I think theres a good feeling among students at our school. The students are willing v tohelpus. That doesnt mean that we dont have our problems, but most of the time the students are willing to sit down with us and work them out. Also on the positive side I think we have good teachers and we are very happy with them, Bell said. We have an old budding, but it is well kept up. Bell said he and his staff are working on the outcome based education program as well. He said all of the teachers in the math department have been to OBE workshops. But he said he feels all teachers should have inservice training in outcome Hamilton would like to thank The family of cards and everyone who sent food, money, flowers, in was the hoswhile he the all prayers especially pital.

Be my Valentine, Brami and Prampa, Mommy and Daddy. Some teachers use it better than others, he said, and we also have problems in the halls and rest rooms. But I think it is a positive program. Some negative things happen, but the program is still positive. We give rewards to the students who behave properly such as candy bars, pop, etc. And we also have bench time for students who cant behave properly. The students are required to sit on a bench for a certain period of time, he said. We have a number of students that are repeat offenders. But there are others that dont ever want to have to sit on the bench again. Bell said the school has several ways to honor positive behavior. He said the students who achieve a 3.5 GPA or higher are included on the honor roll. There were about 60 students on the list last quarter. At the request from board member Phyllis Sillitoe, Bell explained a citizenship reward program at the school called the red and black club. These are the students who get above 18 points on our citizenship program, Bell said. When students get their report cards they are graded on their citizenship and given marks such as honors, or satisfactory or even unsatisfactory. The grades are each worth a certain number of points including the unsatisfactory. But that one is worth a zero, he explained. fco You Thank Charles - teachers someone to talk to now and get a shot in the arm for the program. They need to be able to talk to an expert and explain some of the problems they are having and find way s to solve them. Bell also agreed with Dyet that the assertive discipline, they near die high school years, they get into a different ball game and they might have to slow their progress somewhat at that point so they can start their high school years at the correct level, he said. Dyet said he fully supports the Now when back and pick them up at 2:30 Ralph p.m.' Dyet As based education. Bell said he thinks the OBE program has great promise for students. I believe it will help in our (test) scores, he said. We have quite a bit of work to do on it, but were working on it. I think well be ready for this moved along in school when theyre not ready to move. But he said he has had problems with parents refusing when he has suggested it might be best to retain the student in the same grade for another year. But isnt the mastery of teaching concept a solution to that problem where a student isnt moved to another unit until he has mastered the first one, Sorenson asked. for school each day. There are four buses that arrive at 7 : 40 a.m. and leave the school at 3:40 p.m., Dyet explained, and that means 200 kids are running around for an hour and a half.

Sorenson said this is the second year that Mont Harmon has received the state honor. In other actions the board voted to approve the purchase of three new buses at a cost of $47,707 for each complete unit.

A 1971 Dodge will be allowed $2,100 in trade, a 1974 GMC will be allowed $2,400 and a 1975 bus that holds 72 passengers will be allowed $2,500 in trade. The board voted to follow st. Sorensons recommendation removed crews found absolutely no insulation in the ceiling. He asked for, and received, permission to explore what costs would be involved to put insulation above the ceiling of the building. Marra said at Creekview Elementary the work is moving very rapidly as well. He said the painters had started last week and that the accoustical tile was all in. He said sometimes there is a problem with progress being made too rapidly at the construction site. Marra said one day a crew had showed up early to begin work and had to be sent back home because the building wasnt ready for their work. He said the contractor estimated all interior work would be finished within 60 days, with the substantial completion stage being reached within 90 days. In a related action the board approved a change order in the amount of $47,000 to pay for eight-inc- h rock that had to be used in site preparation to stabilize the ground enough to support the school. Marra said provided playground addition specifications were drawn up district officials had not known much of a problem the marshy land on the west end of the school site would cause. Therefore the money for the rock had not been included in the original construction Marra also members the action was beneficial because legislators read them carefully and use them in making decisions on how to vote on the various items. Board member Glade Williams said he felt such an approach should be made because there is only a limited number of recreational facilities available in the southern part of town. The board unanimously approved a motion directing Marra to write a letter to the city to begin work on such a board told Price City had a number of items currently before the Legislature. Sorenson presented board members with lists of all bills that would affect local districts, a synopsis of the major elements of the bill and the districts proposed position based on discussions with district staff members. Sorenson said such a list would be supplied to legislators each week. He said he felt the con- playground.

The reason is that most Social Security business can be taken care of over the telephone, Herman G. Archuleta, Social Security representative in Price, said resently. Unless the persons business is urgent, it is best to call after the middle of the month. Inquiries can be handled more quickly at this time, Archuleta said. Examples of the business that can be handled by phone include: Applying for Social Security benefits. A claim can be started over the telephone and completed by mail. Applying for Medicare. Changing name and address in Social Security records. Reporting a change in marital status. Reporting stopping or starting work or to report any event that can have an effect on benefits. Reporting a lost or stolen check or delayed payment. Getting help in filling out a Medicare form. Arranging for direct deposit. Getting an estimate of a benefit rate. Requesting a statement of earnings. Getting help in requesting a t review of a claims decision. To ask any question about Social Security or to ask for a free publication.

It is exciting for us at CEU to have individuals of this caliber serving on the board, Randolph said. I am looking forward to working with these new members as we work toward making CEU a better in- stitution. The board of trustees of the CEU Foundation oversees the activities of that group. The foundation was established in 1979 to aid the college in such areas as the acquisition and leasing of land, the securing of facilities and the operation of those properties. The foundation also receives real and personal property from public and private sources and accepts charitable donations, gifts and beneficial interests in trusts. Since its founding a major project of the foundation has been the construction of the Townhouse dorm located at 300 East and 500 North. The foundation applied for and received a loan from the Farmers Home Administration to construct the building. CEU is now leasing the dorm from the e or contact foundtion for use by its students. the local Social Security office. transplants, 65-7- 60s, also are increasingly successful. Cornea transplants, which were begun earlier than any of the other transplant operations, have a very high degree of success. Although receiving new corneas does not usually mean the difference between life and death, it very often means the difference between living in a world of sight and light and a world of darkness for the splant surgery,' some of the newer drugs were not available and the management of the person receiving the organ following the surgery was not as well understood. Because life is precious, and many people must wait a ldhg time for donated organs, all of should us consider the possibility of becoming an organ donor upon our own deaths, Ms. Campbell said. Some people needing donated organs wait days, some months and , some for a lifetime. Their life runs out before a donor can be found. At any given time in the United States between 6,000 and 10,000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney. Which ones receive a kidney depends in part on their tissue and blood types. Those managing the programs have tried to make transplants available on the basis of need rather than reserving the expensive operations for those most able to afford them. Kidney transplant surgery, which is done at the LDS Hosptial and University of Utah Medical Center, in Salt Lake City is paid for by Medicare. Many of the other types of transplant surgery are not yet covered but are expected to be in the future. Many insurance companies also pay for kidney and cornea transplant surgery.

For the first time in the states history, the Legislature will convene for a 45, rather than a 60 day session. This is important for two reasons: one, it is leading to a large number of bills being passed hastily; and two, this session 45-da- y may escape the Legislatures watchful eye. WEEK 1 In the first week, the House operated at a snails pace. The majority of the week saw the House either deliberating the set of rules it would operate under or passing resolutions congratulating the Boy Scouts, Tom Barberi, Miss America, and the B.Y.U. football team. WEEK 2 During the second week, two major pieces of legislation rose to the surface. H.B. 70, which would provide an exemption from workmens compensation for individual contractors, and H.B. 110 which amends the existing statutes. right-to-wo- rk H.B. 70, sponsored by Rep. Garbett (R), has as its goal, the establishment of a loophole for contractors who wish to avoid paying workmens comp in case creates an environment an employee is injured on the whereby undesirable legislation job. These contractors, if the bill becomes law, need only transform their present work force into a group of independent contractors. This places the burden of insurance on the individual contractors.

Greg Fausett, a local mortician who has been active in support of the Lions Eye Bank at the University of Utah Medical Center, said that people in this area have responded to the cornea transplant program. Seven percent of the corneas that have been donated in the entire state during the past year have come from this area. Fausett introduced - the related to brain injury. To become a donor one should obtain a donor card which can be signed and carried in the wallet. It is important to inform relatives of the decision to become a relatives donor because make the final decisions, she said. Cards and information can be obtained from the Southeastern Health Utah donors, although potential those with certain neurological conditions, communicable diseases or certain types of injuries are excluded. Other conditions, such as cataracts or the need to wear corrective lenses during ones lifetime, do not necessarily interfere with becoming a succesful donor, Ms. Campbell said. The corneas must be removed within eight hours following death. They can be kept up to 72 hours before transplanting if they are placed in special solutions. For other types of organ donation, the need for haste in obtaining the organ is even greater. The person donating the organ must have suffered brain death, a condition which usually leaves other organs of the body undamaged. Death must occur in a hospital. Only 10 percent of the deaths in the United States occur under these conditions, Ms. Campbell said. Because of these requirements, there is a limit to the number of people who can finally become donors. Yet there are about 20,000 deaths each year iri the United States programs and provide ? in- DL-20- $159.95 At the beginning of the Chamber of Commerce meeting Walter Donaldson, Jr., representing the Department of Wildlife Resources, gave information about why the DWR is requesting increasing the cost of fishing and hunting licenses. The number of people fishing in Utah has inceased 75 percent and the number of hunters has increased 50 percent in recent years and the increases seem to be continuing, Donaldson said. Inflation has made the raising of fish to plant in streams more costly, he said. The frosting on the cake, in regard to DWR finances, was the flooding around Great Salt Lake which washed out 300,000 acres of marsh land which provided refuges for water fowl, he said. In return for increased license fees, DWR will be able to provide an additional six months of fishing each year, expanded bass fishing and more chemical treatment of lakes to improve fishing, he said. c 0 c Automatic Rash o c c 0 o Auto Auto Advance Lens Cover Auto Rewind Prewind Auto Maintenance Free Exposure Setting Batteries last 5 years Sett Timer Feature FUJSCOLOR 35mm HR 1600 24 EXPOSURES -- $3.19 our ale price factory rebate y $19.95 KODAK dlSC 3100 Camera One button lets you catch all the fun!

The hearings will remain closed to the public and press, would she said. The hearings involve taking sworn statements from wit- nesses of the tragic mine fire at the Wilberg mine in Emery County in December in which 27 miners were killed. Their bodies remain inside the sealed mine. Ms. Snyder said members of the Utah Industrial Commission and the United Mine Workers of America would be on hand and a court recorder would keep minutes which will be made public in accordance with the court order. Representatives from Emery Mining Corp. and Utah Power and Light, managers and owners of the Wilberg mine, would hot be allowed into the hearings, she said. According to a court order issued from Salt Lake City on Monday, transcripts of the proceedings must be made available to the public within a week of (he hearing. Ms. Snyder said that it is from past experience that MSHA has deemed it necessary to hold closed hearings. In the 1970s MSHA did hold two public hearings into two disasters and the results were disappointing,\" Ms. Snyder said. She said that very little useful information came out of those hearings. In 1980 we first tried to conduct the hearings in closed meetings and had much more success getting at the bottom of the story,\" she said. She said MSHA has since held about five closed hearings. mw n UJV L HAS BEEN ORDERED TO SELL SELECT OFFICE EQUIPMENT CONTENTS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY WALL-TO-WAL- IT'S GOING FAST DON'T WAIT SELECTION IS STILL GOOD Linoleum Sellout Sleeperat Sofas candidates Most only $k?7 d) sq.yd.

Last weeks game completed the first go around of the home and away schedule for the six teams in the loop. Carbon patterned its win over Pleasant Grove on the Dino court last Friday night very similarly to the victory over a Springville a week earlier fourth quarter surge. It was a nip and tuck contest throughout until the Dinos found the combination in the final period to pull away for the win. Carbon actually won the 70-6- game at the a slim two-poi- nt ). 2 quarter and Frank Compagni all were stretch. The bulk of the Dino scoring came from toe three big men underneath, Compagni getting 19 points, Fausett 18 and Carter 16. The statement that Stewart made earlier in toe season that if his team can get toe ball underneath toe basket to this trio, they can play with any prep team in the state, is proving to be true. Carbon goes on toe road this extended Carbon to overtime before toe Dinos finally won out in toe regional opener on toe Carbon court last month. In commenting on toe fact that his team is indeed on toe top rung of toe league standings coach Stewart said, This is where we wanted to be going into toe second half of the season because weve got tough road games coming up, not only at Payson this week, but Springville and Pleasant Grove later on, I wouldnt trade places with anyone right now.

The Vikings had three more field goals than Carbon. Scott Carter and Scott Revas provided the Dino edge at the line, Carter getting 8 for 9 and Revas, the cool sophomore, had a perfect 6 for 6. The success of Revas at the line has prompted Dino coach Darrell Stewart to our dub the youngster, shooter. designated Along with the excellent record, Carbon had some tough defense to hold back the Vikes and some clutch field goals. An example of the latter; Arnold Skinner hit only two field goals all night, but both came in the last quarter to give the Dinos some breathing room.

Kohlmeier said the girls are becoming more self disiplined, dictating the speed and setting the pace of toe games. He said this has become more apparent against Payson and last week against Pleasant Grove, and the starting five of Clarene Pabst, Natalie Peterson, Jan Jaussi, Beth Hussey and Paige Lamph have smoothed out and really started clicking together. The guards had their best game of toe year, Kohlmeier said, with Patterson scoring 12 points and grabbing six 55-4- rebounds and Lamph with 10 points and two rebounds. Jaussi scored six points and pulled nine rebounds. Patterson and Lamph were high on toe assist total, getting toe ball inside to center Pabst who was high with 20 points and 14 rebounds, while Hussey worked on the rebounds with nine and six points. The Lady Dinos had no problems with fouls either. Jaussi ended up with a fourth late in the game and Hussey totaled three. The defensive unit was effective, Kohlmeier said, shutting Debbie Miller, usually a 20 point scorer for Payson, down to six points. The Lady Dinos will begin the second round of region play Thursday with Lehi here. Kohlmeier said toe girls are gunning to beat Spanish Fork and Springville, the two region defeats the Carbon women have suffered. state Five Carbon wrestlers will be making toe trip to toe state tournament after placing in toe region tournament last weekend.

Guard Connie Atkinson was able to work well inside, Brooks said, and was able to get a personal record of 40 points. The women kept it a running game, and toe guards were able to keep up toe momentum. Offensively, the Lady Eagles worked to get Dixie in foul trouble, working all week on drawing fouls from the taller Dixie women reaching over toe top. Brooks said this strategy accomplished their goal, getting the Dixie women in foul trouble early on. The running game took its toll on toe Dixie women as .they seemed to run out of steam in toe last three minutes of toe game. Brooks said.

The CEU women kept with a man to man defense and it worked to their atvantage. Brooks said, as when toe CEU squad took on toe Snow team two weeks ago, Snow was able to move out while toe Eagles were switching between man to man and zone defenses. CEU kept with a running game, but started to slow down towards toe end of toe game and Snow started to move ahead.

Elk were fairly widespread and abundant in Utah before the pioneers arrived. Early settlers hunted elk and other big game as a source of food. They were very efficient in the quest for big game, particularly elk. As early as the 1880s, the native game herds were severely depleted. By the early 1900s, the only elk left in the state were a remnant herd in the Uinta Mountains. evaporated like a dream, and was, for many years, but a memory of times past. By the early 1900s, Rocky Mountain elk had dwindled from a continental population of perhaps 10 million animals to remnant populations totaling about 90,000, found only in strongholds of western America. However, since that period, a great effort has been made to reintroduce big game ceiini'Eirodyce Elk transplanted to Utah from the Yellowstone area provided the seed for todays herds. During recent years elk have flourished in Utah. The current population is about 25,000 animals.. Elk numbers and range are expanding, with no indication of problems due to lack of habitat. It appears that the future could be bright for Utah elk. We are at a time of important decisions with respect to elk management. Utah has a good potential from a habitat standpoint, but concerns about elk are growing among some groups. Some livestock people are concerned aobut damage problems created by elk. At the same time, public interest and support for progressive elk management .s at an all-tim- e high. Historically, the solution to elk problems has been to eliminate the elk. But it has Limiting populations Illegal wildlife kills on the increase crime are so valuable, and the Illegal killing of wildlife for pleasure and profit is growing like a cancer across the United States and is becoming a limiting factor on wildlife populations in some localized situations, wildlife professionals say. Utah Division of Wildlife Resources law enforcement chief Paul Woodbury told a group of fisheries and wildlife professionals meeting at Utah State University that every state echoes the problems of illegal commercialization of probabilties of apprehension so low. We need penalties sufficiently harsh to deter the criminal element, Phillips said. Samuel Alba, assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting Utah, said attorneys have for often avoided cases involving wildlife, but the attitude is changing in the Utah office because the attorneys are becoming more educated wildlife law. in Illegal commercialization according to USU wildlife professor Michael Wolfe, can have serious impacts on wildlife Wolfe said in propitiations. many cases the number of illegal kills equals or exceeds the legal kill. Although there are no sure ways of estimating the number of illegal kills, Wolfe said, they do impact populations. Commonly, species of wildlife most pursued by poachers are the rare species which are less capable of dealing with increased pressure. These species include eagles, grizzly bears and big game animals like bighorn sheep and mountain goats. Their rare status makes those animals appealing to poachers because of their high dollar value. elk to habltot been demonstrated and ed that other available, practical solutions are far more preferable. Elk are highly-prize- d big game animals, quite able to pay their way in Utah. Money collected from big game hunting licenses and elk permits can more than offset damages caused by the animals. Damage such as depredation on haystacks can be eliminated through fencing provided by the Division of Wildlife Resources to landowners who have legitimate damage problems. Landowners play host to an enormous number of elk and deer every winter. Indeed, most critical big game winter range in Utah is on private land. Hunters must get away from the attitude that all landowners are the system when ripping-of- f for receive compensation they depredation or fencing supplies to prevent damage. Certainly, there are a few who have taken advantage of the system. But more often, the rancher has suffered depredation problems and has not said anything. For the most part, the ranchers and farmers of the state enjoy wildlife, but cant afford to support them at the expense of their livelihood. Ranchers and farmers were among the first groups to recognize the plight of wildlife last winter, and they were strong supporters of efforts to save big game herds. A small amount ($2.00) is earmarked in the 1985 proposed big game license increase for controlling depredation from big game. Utah hunters seem to be willing to pay for a progressive elk management program which will provide a significant recreational return of their investment. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources is very optimistic about the future of elk management in Utah. It is felt that our current trend of growing elk herds will continue, as will public interest and support for the elk management program. V if American Heart Association wildlife. He said the problem is more serious than many wildlife officials think it is. y As part of a meeting of the Utah Chapter of the Wildlife Society and the Bonneville Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, wildlife and two-da- fisheries biologists, and wardens professionals addressed topic. Woodbuy said illegal mercialization , game other differs the MUG com- from poaching in only one regard and that is illegally killing or taking wildlife for profit. He said the high dollar value of wildlife has been an incentive for people to get involved in illegal wildlife trade. He pointed out that trophy animals such as elk, mountain goats and bighorn sheep command especially high prices, which puts additional pressure on already' relatively ' , scarce animals. Utah is not untouched by the illegal wildlife trade, Woodbury said. We have various forms of commercialization from Lake Powell in the south to Cache Valley in the north. We have situations on record of fish being netted out of Lake Powell for commercial use in restaurants in Phoenix, reservoirs used for gross illegal taking of fish for canning and resale, and deer and elk meat being sold by grocery stores as jerky and hamburger, he added. Recently in Tooele County a meat jobber from Salt Lake City was found processing large amounts of illegally killed game meat, he added. From small butcher shops in the field to more sophisticated operations, Woodbury said deer and elk are being illegally killed and processed and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Wildlife is not killed just for meat. Antlers are worth big Woodbury told the bucks, the grim evidence and audience, of elk killed only for their antlers is found virtually everywhere the animals are. Bald eagles, golden eagles and other birds of prey are especially valuable, and are particulary vulnerable to poachers and wildlife thieves. Nando Mauldin, a special agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, elaborated on one undercover investigation that led to the arrest and conviction of more than 50 people from several states who were killing and selling eagles and . other raptors. Marty Phillips, resident agent for the FWS Law Enforcement Operations, said penalties for wildlife violations vary across . , the country. In Utah, for example, a sport violation can result in a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum fine of $1,000, a year in jail, or both.

Police patches Jailer holds key to curious collection patch from the Alaska Highway Patrol, he received six others from around the nation. By MICHAEL DAME Staff writer It is easy to name the few local police departments and many around the state, but it is incredible how many there are around the world. Carbon County Jailer Marty Estrada and other police officers who collect police patches know how many there are and often how difficult it is to find all the departments. In only Six months of collecting patches, Estrada has received several hundred in the mail. Most were sent free as a those in courtesy, but some he high demand by collectors had to buy. Its a fun hobby but it can get expensive at times, Estrada said. Just the postage alone sometimes costs a lot. Some patches are just too expensive, Estrada said. The Dodge City, Kansas police patch, for instance, costs $7. Estrada obtained some of the patches by trading patches he already had for those other collectors wanted. For one collector from Williamsburg, Penn., has 3,000 patches from around the world but not many from western states and wanted to trade for some, Estrada said. A . Jailer Steve Laud and dispatcher Barbara Kelley also collect patches, but Estrada said their efforts currently are directed at collecting patches from the 50 state highway patrol departments. Estrada collects patches from every department willing to send them. He has patches from 27 corrections departments around the nation, 30 Canadian police departments and patches from Germany and Australia. Many of the machine sewn patches display unique scenes reflective of the areas where the departments are located. Flying eagles, Indians with bow and arrow, fish or more frequently, the scales of justice appear on many patches. Estrada has patches from the Bureau of Indian Affairs police academy, the Washington D.C. Metro Police, New York City Police, U.S. Marshalls office, U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs office and other well known departments. Some of the smaller departments have names most people infrequently hear, such as Peel Regional Police, Polida De Puerto Rico, Edmont City Police, Kalamazoo Sheriffs ,, ; f Marty Estrada Dept., and others. Then there are patches from cities school children study, such as St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest city in the nation; or the Leadville, Colo, police, the highest city in the country. There are also patches from , , Above are some of the local police patches Carbon County Jailer Marty Estrada has collected as part of his hobby. Estrada has several hundred patches from agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and other cities which often provide the backdrops for current movies and television shows, such as the El Paso City Police and the Lubbock County Sheriffs Dept. Collecting patches among police is not just a hobby practiced in this country; the interest is present among police around the world, Estrada said. Helper City Police Chief Karl Stavar, for instance, received a letter in December from Travagliato, Italy. Officer Gatti Giovanni introduced himself as a patrolman who is collecting police items for his departments future police museum. Unlike collectors who ask only for patches, Giovanni asked for patches, badges, police batons, hats and other items. Stavar said he gets letters frequently throughout the year and usually sends only patches. This time, Stavar sent a badge andapatch. Police museums can be found departments. In the center column on the left is one of the original Carbon County Sheriff's office patches. Officers from around the world are involved in the hobby. around the world. Among the mast famous is the Federal Bureau . of Investigation museum which includes displays of police memorabilia and artifacts. Although there is no police museum in Utah, there are many badge and patch collectors. Logan City Police Chief Ferris Groll is also a collector of police patches and badges and has amassed a collection of hundreds of items over trie years. Bill Hedges, a retired officer from the Santa Anna, Calif, police department, took up the hobby of collecting police badges several years ago and has been featured in newspapers all over the country displaying some of the several thousand badges he has obtained. Estrada said he intends to collect as many patches as he has time and money to obtain. I ",

SMITH Utah Health Department Have you ever gone to great lengths to protect a precious possession or package while riding in your automobile? Just the other day I purchased a porcelain figurine and after moving it around to various places' in my car, I finally decided that the only safe way to transport it was to buckle it into a seat belt. Children are precious worth far more than any and therefore possession deserve to be protected in the be equipped with child restraints or safety belts are occupied by other passengers, (3) the law will be enforced in all vehicles except authorized properly buckle them up. One out of every 57 children bom in Utah will be seriously injured or killed in a motor campers, sleepers, motor- accident before reaching his or her fifth birthday. If all children involved in traffic accidents had been properly restrained, estimates suggest there would have been 19 fewer deaths and at least 300 fewer serious injuries among Utahs children from 1979 to 1982. In order to better protect the children of Utah, the Utah State Poetry Legislature prize will be offered A $1,000 adults give the same amount of time and attention to securing the safety of our children. Children are certainly worth the price of a car safety restraint device and the time it takes to vehicle best possible way. After buckling up my porcelain figurine I wondered if we as grand prize is being offered in World of Poetrys New Poetry Contest, open to all poets. There are 100 prizes in all, with a cash value of over passed Utahs Law of Love which went into effect July 1, 1984. Important facts about the law to remember are: (1) all children up to the age of 2 years must ride in a child safety seat, (2) children between the ages of 2 and 5 must use either a child safety seat or safety belt, unless all seating positions which can emergency vehicles, mopeds, cycles, motorhomes, school buses, taxi cabs, vehicles owned, operated or leased by a public transit, district, or vehicles which weigh over 10,000 pounds gross weight and are not equipped with seat belts by the manufacturer, and (4) a person convicted of violating the law shall be fined not less than $20 per offense. However, the charge will be dismissed as long as the driver submits proof of acquisition, rental, or puchase of a child restraint device(s) or safety belt(s) before or during any court appearance concerning the law. Lets give our children the love and protection they need. Always buckle your child and while youre at it fasten your own safety belt.

Be sure when you fill your containers to leave an inch of container wall above the soil mix. This will help prevent spills or other problems when Gardening in containers is possible if$ou dont have a lot of space in your yard. Each container should be scrubbed well to remove fungus spores or insect eggs. Soak porous containers so that they dont absorb the moisture away from the soil mix. Dampen the soil mix then put it in the containers. There are many types of soil mixes. If you need just a small amount you might want to buy one of the available soil mixes and avoid further mess. If you use a soil mix really high in organic matter it may become soggy. To lighten up this type of mix you can add one third to one half sand or perlite. This will .

Most people are more certain about their roles as parents than as grandparents. Dr. Glen Jenson, head of the department of family and human development at Utah State University, said research indicates that grandparenting roles fall into these five basic categories: 1. The formal grandparent: these are grandparents who policy. They adopt a hands-of- f provide little substitute child care for the parents of their grandchildren.

About 29 percent of grandmothers and 24 percent of grandfathers fit this category. 3. The surrogate-typ- e grandparent: this role is usually performed by the grandmother. The major role is caring for the children while the parents are employed or performing other activities. About 14 percent of grandmothers and virtually no grandfathers fit this category. 4.

Former football great, Merlin Olsen, and his wife, Susan, are serving as honorary chairmen for the 1985 campaign. This is their eighth year of involvement with the hospital. Campaign chairwoman Myrl Hamilton said the goal for the 1985 campaign is $1.2 million or more. Every cent raised will be spent on one thing: to cover hospital expenses of needy children. Physicians who treat charity care children donate their time, she said. In fact, all monies raised by the annual drive go to help children. Campaign officials said no money is kept to pay administrative costs. All work is performed on a volunteer basis. The canvass includes the service area of the hospital. That area includes all of Utah plus parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Montana, California, Arizona, New ! door-to-do- or Mexico, and Oregon Washington. For 63 years Primary Childrens Medical Center has provided pediatric medical treatment to children regardless of race, religion or the ability to pay. In 1984 it provided $2.1 million in care for which the center was not repaid. Hospital officials said much of the charity care the facility provides is possible because of the annual Pennies by the Inch campaign. Each year the facility-carefor some 5,500 children as inpatients, another 38,000 on an outpatient basis, treats 8,800 in its emergency room, performs s 9,909 surgical conducts procedures, 24,500 examinations and charts about 400,000 laboratory tests. In 1983 there were 4,490 x-r- ay children from Utah alone admitted for specialized care not available in general or community hospitals. Hospital officials said the facility receives children from throughout the intermountain west as well as from around the world. In its early days many of the patients .were crippled children who ; required - many patient days for convalescing. They said the ability to treat specialized complex problems has expanded as the length of stay has dropped. Primary psychiatry Childrens department has been recognized as a model by the profession. Officials said ultrasound and laser surgery techniques are pioneering efforts in their fields and research accounts for major advances in the treatment and diagnosis of congenital birth defects and complications of prematurity. The cardiology division at the hospital is a leader in treatment of children with heart diseases and disorders.

Each year there are some predictable v trouble spots with federal income tax forms, according to the Internal Revenue Service. These are areas where large numbers of taxpayers make incorrect entries and thereby slow the processing of tax forms. These trouble spots fall into two broad categories: problems that recur each year, such as taxpayers selecting the incorrect figure from the tax tables; and problems that stem from changes in the tax laws and forms from one year to the next, such as the addition of a new line to a form or the shift of an existing line to a new position on the form. Not surprisingly, the largest percentage of errors are made on Form 1040, the long form. To assist filers of this form, IRS has compiled the following list of problem areas to 3. Unemployment to changes in Compensation. Due the tax law last year, this item moved into the list of most common errors. Doublecheck your figures on the worksheet in the tax instruction booklet (page 10), and make appropriate entries on lines 20a and 20b. double-- This item is not entered on Form 1040, but on a related schedule. Because Schedule A was redesigned last year, this item will probably lead the list of last years most common errors. Due to rule changes on medical deductions, IRS expects problems again this year. Be sure to check the limitation on medical expenses. 1. Medical Deductions. 7. EIC Error Round Off Figures, Make Fewer Errors Copies of federal income tax returns from prior years not only serve as good financial records, but they can serve as guides for filling out future returns as well, the Internal Revenue Service said. A good deal of information may be utilized from old copies, especially for those taxpayers whose financial situations stay almost the same from year to year, according to the IRS. , ' Being able to refer to completed returns could also be helpful to those who might lata- wish to amend their returns, income average or who are called in for a tax examination. Taxpayers may round off cents to the nearest dollar when figuring their federal income taxes, the Internal Revenue Service said. However, if a taxpayer rounds off one dollar item, all amounts must be rounded off. Amounts under 50 cents should be dropped and amounts from 50 cents to 99 cents should be increased to the next highest dollar. For example, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.69 becomes $3. . One advantage to rounding off, to the IRS, is that taxpayers are likely to make fewer errors in math. - SALE complicated and intimidating forms for individual filers, due to the number of tax years covered on the form.

If the person is not one of the relatives listed, he or she was a member of your household and lived with you for the entire year. 5. If married, the person is not filing a joint return with his or her spouse OR neither the person or the person's spouse is required to file but they are filing a joint return only to claim a refund of tax withheld. Correct Answers: TRUE for all five. If you checked TRUE for all statements you may claim the person as your dependent Note: There are special rules for children of divorced or separated parents and for persons supported by more than one taxpayer.

Check your W-Wage and Tax Statement, to see if any federal income tax was withheld. If any was withheld and you have no tax liability, filing a return is the only way to recover the money that was withheld. If you expect to have no tax liability again in 1985 and your income will be below the amount required to file a return, you can avoid having to file a tax return to recover your tax withheld by giving your employer a new form W-Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate, claiming exemption from withholding.

The advantage of the withholding exemption, according to the IRS, is that a taxpayer who would ordinarily receive a full refund of money withheld will not have to file a return. However, claiming exemption from withholding of federal income tax has no effect on a taxpayers social security (FICA) tax withholding, the IRS pointed ouf.

Generally, you will benefit from itemizing deductions if you paid interest and taxes on a home you own, or had unusually large uninsured medical and dental expenses during the year, or made large contributions to qualified charitable organizations, or had major uninsured casualty losses. What this means is that you will probably have itemized deductions totalling more than the zero bracket amount for your filing status. Taxpayers who itemize deductions reduce their adjusted gross income by their excess itemized deductions. Excess itemized deductions is the amount by which total itemized deductions exceeds the zero bracket amount. For example, a married couple filing jointly, with itemized deductions of SS.S00, would subtract their zero bracket amount of $3,400 from the $3,500 in order to determine their excess itemized deductions of $2,100. Although adjusted gross income is reduced by only the excess itemized deductions, all deductions are allowed. Itemized deductions are deductions. If you itemize your deductions, you must file Form 1040 and fill in Schedule A (Form 1040). Schedule A provides space for listing deductible medical and dental expenses, charitable contributions, taxes, interest paid, casualty or theft losses, and miscellaneous items such as union dues. Taxpayers who itemize can take advantage of many deductible expenses. ss . Here is a brief explanation of some types of deductions available: Charitable Contributions penses you paid during 1984 to the extent that they exceed five percent of your adjusted gross income. If you were reimbursed by insurance or other means, that amount must be subtracted from your medical expenses. Payments for the diagnosis, cure, prevention, or treatment of a physical or mental illness are deductible as are payments for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. Deductible medical expenses include your payments to doctors, dentists, psychiatrists, etc.; payments to hospitals for service, laboratory fees, etc.; and, payments for eyeglasses, Generally, you may deduct contributions given to any qualified organization established and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, educational, scientific, or literary purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals; to certain organizations that foster national or international amateur sports competition; to fraternal organizations if the contributions are used for charitable purposes; to veterans' organizations; or, to governmental agencies that will use the gifts exclusively for public pur- hearing aids and parts, dentures, crutches, etc. Things not allowed are trips taken to \"get away from it all, even if advised by a doctor, health club dues, maternity clothes, and diaper services. Expenses for transportation essential to medical care such as getting to and from a doctors office may be included in medical expenses. This includes taxi, bus, train, or plane fares. If you use your car, you may deduct the actual expenses, such as gas and oil, or nine cents for each mile you use your car for this purpose. In addition, you may deduct parking fees and tolls. Be sure to keep track of your expenses and mileage. For 1984, the one percent limit for drugs will no longer apply, and deductible drugs will include insulin and drugs that are only obtainable with a prescription. poses. This means you may deduct contri- butions to most religious organizations, community funds. Boy Scouts, the YMCA, the Red Cross, the American Cancer Society, CARE, Veterans of Foreign Wars, etc. You may not deduct contributions to civic leagues or chambers of commerce. If you donate property other than money, you must base your deduction on the fair market value of the property, that is, the amount you could reasonably charge if you were selling the property. Bear in mind a contribution is only a contribution at the time of its delivery. Pledges are not contributions until you make payment. Also, if a contribution results in a personal benefit, all or part of it may not be deductible. For example, if you buy a $50 ticket for a church benefit and receive a meal at the function worth $15, you can only claim $35 as a charitable contribution. Interest Interest paid during the year on a debt for which you are legally responsible is deductible. This includes uch debts as a car loan, a bank loan, an educational loan. Medical Expenses You may deduct the medical ex ductible on your federal income tax return. or a mortgage of your home. However, if in 1984, you prepaid interest allocable to any period after 1984, you can only deduct the amount of interest allocable to 1984 on your 1984 return. If you buy such things as clothing, a radio or TV set, furniture, or household appliances on an installment plan, budget charge account or credit card that lists a finance charge, you may treat the finance charge payment as interest. In general, interest deductions must meet the following tests: the interest must result from an actual debtor-creditrelationship; the interest must be based on a valid obligation to pay a sum of money; and, the debt must be one for which you are legally liable. . or . Miscellaneous Deductions These deductions include such items as union dues; the cost of safety equipment, tools, and supplies used in your job including professional and trade journals; and, expenses incurred in seeking new employment in the same trade or business. Job hunting expenses are not deductible if you're seeking employment in a new field of work. You can also deduct the rent on your g safety deposit box if you keep items in it, such as stocks and bonds. Taxpayers who hire someone to prepare their tax returns can deduct the fee paid to the preparer. If you legally adopt a child with special needs, you may be able to deduct up to $1,500 of qualified adoption expenses as a miscellaneous deduction. A child with special needs is one who the state determines as described in the Social Security Act adoption assistance program. This is a child who the state determines cannot or should not be returned to his or her parental home, who has specific factor or condition that makes the child difficult to place, and who has been the subject of an unsuccessful placement effort. Qualified adoption expenses include reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses that are directly related to the adoption of the child. Adoption expenses do not include any expenses for which you may receive a credit or that you may otherwise deduct. In addition, you may not deduct any expenses for which you received payments from a federal, state, or local program to pay for your adoption income-producin- Taxes The following state or local taxes you paid during the year are deductible: state or local income tax (including tax withheld or paid as estimated tax during year), real property tax, personal property tax, general sales tax and contributions to certain state disability benefit funds.

This also applies to settlements in effect before that date. Generally, the gain or loss is the difference between the adjusted basis of the property and its fair market value at the time of the transfer. If the property has increased in value there may be a taxable gain, while a decrease in value would result in a loss. However, a loss is only deductible if the property is business or investment property. The spouse making the transfer would realize the gain or loss on the 1040X Form Used To Correct Errors Errors on previously filed tax returns can be corrected by filing an amended return, the Internal Revenue Service said.

An equal division of property that is by both spouses does not result in a gain or loss, according to the IRS. However,' the Tax Reform Act of 1984 changed the rules for divorce property settlements, the Internal Revenue Service said. If assets are transferred after July 18, 1984, to a former spouse as a part of a divorce property settlement, there will be no gain or loss on the transfer. The transfer will be treated as a gift from the spouse making the transfer. The adjusted basis in the property of the spouse making the transfer will cany over to the spouse receiving the property. The new rules can apply to all transfers made after 1983 if both spouses choose to have them apply. IRS Publication 304, Tax Information for Divorced or Separated Individuals, is available free by using the handy order form in the tax forms package or calling the IRS. Those who discover they have failed to report some income or claim tax credits or deductions, and those who erroneously claimed deductions or credits to which they were not entitled, can file to correct these errors. However, the agency noted, it is not necessary to file an amended return to correct addition and subtraction errors. These are automatically corrected by computers at IRS service centers when the returns are processed. It is also not necessary to file an amended return if a required schedule was not submitted. If this is the case, IRS will write to request the schedule or attachment The amended return is filed on Form 1040 X,L Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and can be used to correct any previously filed Form 1040, 1040 A, or 1040EZ. Form 1040X must be filed within three years from the date of the original return or within two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later, the IRS said. Moving Expenses . . . Workers who changed jobs last year or started a new job may be able to deduct moving expenses, even if he or she does not itemize deductions.

'Good Neighbor ' ' Service Some Must Report State Tax Refunds . ' Taxpayers who received income tax refunds in 1984 from taxes paid in an earlier year to a state or local government may have to report the refunds as income on their 1984 federal tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service said. . Generally, a state or local tax refund should be reported as income only if the taxpayer itemized deductions on Schedule A of the 1983 Form 1040, and deducted income taxes paid to the state or local government. Refunds of federal income taxes are not considered income on a federal tax return. However, interest earned on a delayed federal refund is income and must be reported, the IRS noted. State and local governments still furnish annual information statements similar to those required of financial institutions on interest and dividends to the IRS for all taxpayers who receive refunds, credits or offsets of $10 or more from their state andor local governments. However, state and local governments are not required to issue such statements to taxpayers, unless the taxpayer itemized deductions on Schedule A of the prior year Form 1040. Free Tax Help for The Elderly Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) is a program coordinated by the Internal Revenue Service through it which organizations provide free tax information and assistance to individuals age 60 and over. Volunteers are specially trained by IRS to help older Americans with the tax credit for the elderly, the double personal exemption, the special treatment of the gain on the sale of a home by an elderly person, the proper method of reporting pension income and paying tax on it when necessary, and other subjects of special interest and concern. These volunteers will also help taxpayers fill out their tax returns. TCE programs are provided in neighborhood areas which makes getting needed help easier and more convenient. Taxpayers age 60 or over who require assistance should call the IRS tax information number listed in local telephone directories for locations in their area. non-prof- Before You Invest In IRAs, Read IRS Disclosure Statements An Individual Retirement Arrangement should' be chosen carefully and all financial aspects of it checked thoroughly, the Internal Revenue Service advises, IRAs may be bought from different sources such as banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds the IRS explains, and savers should compare IRAs from these different sources to choose the one that is best for his or ha situation. Some things to look for when shopping for an IRA are: How much are the fees? What is the interest rate and how is it figured? How much will you have in your account when you are ready to retire? The Internal Revalue Service lions taxpayers about misleading or incomplete disclosure statements related to Individual Retirement Arrangements. Even though the federal tax law on IRAs in general requires complete and accurate disclosure by financial institutions, important details are sometimes omitted, the IRS notes. For example, two investments may advertise the same interest rate but, because the interest rates are figured differently, a saver may earn more with one investment than with anotha. A prospective IRA purchaser should ask questions and try to obtain as much information as possible before signing on the dotted line, the IRS says. One good way to determine which financial instrument is the best overall investment is to examine the part of the institutions disclosure statement that gives a projection of the value of the investment at the end of each of the first 3 years and also at ages 60, 63 and 70. - Withdrawal penalties for money that is taken out prematurely are also supposed to be reflected in these projections, the IRS adds. The IRS notes that the Tax Reform Act of 1984 requires that taxpayers must contribute to their IRAs by April 13, 1983 for the contribution to apply to the 1984 tax year. Extensions to file a federal tax return no longer extend the deadline for contributing to the IRA. More information on IRAs is available in IRS Publication 390, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). To obtain it, use the order form in the tax package or call the IRS.

It is designed to teach juniors and seniors an important life skill, how to take advantage of their federal tax rights and discharge their tax responsibilities. The following questions and answers have been prepared by the IRS to explain the program. Q. What is covered in the Understanding Taxes curriculum? A. The course includes chapters on the economics of taxation, the politics of taxation, facts and fallacies about the IRS and a general overview of state taxes. Since most students usually have a small income and will first file the short Form 1040EZ, a line by line explanation of the 104GEZ is covered in one of the modules. Q. How can students take the Understanding Taxes course? A. The IRS offers the comprehensive course, complete with all educational materials, to any interested high school, adult education or cen- ter. The Understanding Taxes program can last from two weeks to a semester if taught in its entirety, or from one to five days if only particular chapters are covered. It can be incorporated into math, civics, economics, vocational edu- - Free Publications Q. Will Understanding Taxes cost us money? A. No. The IRS has prepared student course books, teacher manuals, visual aids and audiovisual materials that are provided free of charge to participating schools. Q. How much preparation and tax knowledge do I need to teach this course? A. Very little. The teachers manual and supplementary material will provide everything you need. The manual includes course objectives, lesson plans and suggestions for extra credit projects. Q. Are many high school students taking advantage of the Understanding Taxes curriculum? A. Yes. In the 1984 school year, four million students in high schools nationwide took the Understanding Taxes program. Some cities and states even require the course . for graduation or use it almost exclusively to meet state requirements for teaching taxes. Q. How do we get an Understanding Taxes program started in our school? Contact your local IRS district Taxpayer Education Coordinator for details. An interested parent should contact the school's principal and inform him or her about the program. If you have a tax question or problem, there is probably a publication that will answer it. The Internal Revenue Service has more than 90 free publications to assist taxpayers with the complicated tax laws. There are also several publications written in Spanish.

To guard against undesirable actions, paid preparers are responsible for providing a copy of the completed return to the client for hisher records when. the client signs. Preparers are required to keep copies of prepared returns or a list containing taxpayers names and identification numbers for three years. These records must be available for IRS inspection during this period. Form 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ paid preparers are also required to sign and date completed returns and to provide their employer identification number on the return. Because of potential misuse, rubber stamps and signature facsimiles are not accepted by the IRS. The handling of refund checks is also regulated. A penalty of $500 can be assessed against paid preparers who endorse, cash, or in any way negotiate a clients refund check. In addition, understating a clients tax liability can lead to a penalty of $100 for negligent of intentional disregard or regulations. 25 Farmers Tax Guide 334 Tax Guide for Small Business Reasonable Rates Experienced Preparer By appointment only. 7AR-9- 1 Call after 5 p.m. IfO How much can you expect from an IRA? 524 Credit for the Elderly and the Permanently and Totally Ask Disabled S26 Charitable Contributions IRS Will Compute Tax for Some Taxpayers 903 Energy Credits for Individuals 907 Tax Information for Handicapped and Disabled Individuals 910 Taxpayers Guide to IRS Information, Assistance and Publications 915 Tax Information on Social Security Benefits (and Tier I Railroad Retirement Benefits) aafMFiDS' Form 1040EZ and Form 1040A filers and certain taxpayers filing Form 1040 may request that the Internal Revenue Service figure their taxes for ' them.

The agency will figure the tax in the way that benefits the taxpayer the most, IRS stressed. Since eligible persons need only complete certain questions, IRS said they will probably finish their returns faster and with less opportunity for error. If a refund is due, the IRS will figure the amount and send it to the taxpayer. If additional tax is owed, it will be computed and a bill sent for the balance.

Federal income tax is now generally withheld from pension and annuity payments. However, this withholding is not compulsory; any person can apply for exemption. The payer of the pension or annuity payments will tell the retiree how to file for the exemption. To determine whether to have tax withheld, taxpayers should review the tax rules that cover pensions and annuities. A pension to which an employee contributed nothing during his or her employment, for example, is fully taxable in much the same way salaries and wages are during working years. The full amount must be reported as income on the line designated for fully taxable pensions and annuities on Form 1040. The 1040 A and 1040EZ forms cannot be used to report pension income, the IRS said. Income Tax Preparation years experience preparing 14 tax returns in Carbon & Emery counties. Professionally prepare in the convenience of your own home. CALL FOR APPOINTMENT Boyd Snow 687-997- 1 Equitable Insurance Agency has been serving Avoid Delays and Errors on Your On the other hand, a pension to which both the employer and employee contributed, while not fully taxable, is partially taxable and is subject to special tax reporting. If a retiree will recover his or her total contributions within 36 months after the first payment is received, then the pension or annuity payments are not taxed until the contributions are recovered. This is because the contributions were taxed while the person was employed. Those who will not recover their contributions within a period are entitled to exclude from taxable income a certain percentage of their pensions each year. Normally, the issuer of the pension will compute the exclusion percentage the figure that determines how much of a pension can be excluded from income. The exclusion percentage, once computed, does not change. If the issuer of the pension does not compute this percentage, instructions can be found in the free IRS Publication S73, Pension and An- Tax Returns Many simple errors that can cause weeks of delay in the processing of federal income tax returns could be avoided if taxpayers used the labels and envelopes that accompany their tax packages, the Internal Revenue Service says. The peel-oflabel, which contains the taxpayers name, address and social security number, is designed to expedite processing at IRS service centers and prevent common errors that can delay issuance of refund checks. A common misconception is that address label will using the peel-otrigger an audit. Actually, coding on the label identifies the taxpayer and the kind of forms contained in his or her tax package. It does not in any way indicate the return should be audited. . One of the common and yet most troublesome errors that can be averted by use of the label is the listing of an incorrect or illegible Social Security number. Such an error can take weeks or even months to correct, and is one of the major cause of delayed refund T th ff nuity Income. This publication will have the answers to most questions on the tax treatment of pensions and annuities, and can be ordered by using the handy order form found in each tax package. In addition, for persons 60 years of age and over, free tax counseling is available through local Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs. Through this program, specially trained volunteers provide tax assistance on such matters as tax credit for the elderly, special treatment of the gain on the sale of a home by those age 33 and over, the proper method of reporting certain pension income and paying tax on it when necessary, and other subjects of special interest and concern to older persons. The volunteers also help fill out tax returns. checks. . ' The IRS advises taxpayers to use the label, even if corrections are necessary. For example, in the case of a change of address, the correction should be made directly on the label. Errors can also be averted if taxpayenveers use the special lope, which speeds sorting of tax re-- turns during the annual deluge of mail that arrives at the ten IRS service cen- -' ters. IRS also advises taxpayers to round off cents to the nearest dollar when figuring federal income taxes. However, taxpayers should be consistent. If you do round off do so for all amounts. Drop amounts under 50 cents and in- crease amounts from 30 to 99 cents to the next dollar. Taxpayers are likely to make fewer math errors by rounding off. Deferred Gain on Home Sale Must Be Reported Homeowners who sell or exchange a personal residence and postpone paying taxes on any gain from the sale must report the transaction in the year of the sale, the Internal Revenue Service says. The sale must be reported using the Form 21 19, Sale or Exchange of Principal Residence, ..available by using the handy order blank in the tax package. If a taxable gain results, Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses, must also be used. The IRS monitors the returns of taxpayers whose circumstances suggest a sale which should be reported, such as a return showing a change of address and a real estate deduction, but without the required form attached. Generally, the gain from the sale of a principal residence is not taxed at the if a more expensive retime placement residence is purchased and occupied within 24 months before or after the sale of your home. The tax may be postponed, according to the IRS, but it is not forgotten. Any gain realized from the sale must be subtracted from the cost or basis of of-sa- y .

If the ($30,000 second house is eventually sold for $65,000 and not replaced, the owner . must pay a tax on $23,000 ($63,000 . $40,000), the combined gain from both homes. However, if the owner is at least 55 years of age when the home is sold, he or she may be eligible to elect a e exclusion of up to special $123,000 of the gain. The IRS points out the sale must be reported to establish a record of the current basis upon which taxes on the deferred gain can be figured.

Many taxpayers filing as heads of households have been needlessly delaying their tax refunds by not listing the names of qualifying children, the Internal Revenue Service said. To file as a head of household, a taxpayer must be unmarried or qualify to file as unmarried, and provide more than half the cost of keeping up a home that is the principal home of the taxpayer and the taxpayers unmarried child (who may be either a dependent or not), or a married child who must be the taxpayers dependent Other qualifying relatives must be - the taxpayers dependents, and must actually live with the taxpayer the entire year. The taxpayers dependent parents, however, may qualify even though they do not live with the taxpayer. The taxpayer must have paid more than half the cost of keeping up their home in order to qualify for bead of household filing status. To be considered unmarried, the IRS said, one must be single, legally separated, divorced, or widowed. However, certain unmarried persons living apart with a dependent child may qualify as single. Unmarried individuals who are not eligible to file as head of household must file as single unless they qualify as a qualifying widow or widower with a dependent child. . ",

Single (under age 65) Single (age 65 or over) .53,300 $4,300 Married filing a joint re55.400 turn Married filing a joint return (one spouse age 65 or 56,400 over) Married filing a joint return (both spouses age 65 or over) 57,400 Married filing a separate return 51,000 Surviving spouse (Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child) 54,400 Surviving spouse (age 65 or 55,400 over) In addition, you will have to file an income tax return if any of the following situations apply: You received tips from which social security tax was not withheld. You were in business for yourself and had a net earning or 5400 or more from that business. This is called income. You had unearned income of 51,000 or more, such as dividends or interest, and can be claimed as a dependent by someone else. This is particularly important to students. You received Advance Earned Income Credit payments. You have alternative minimum tax You withdrew from your IRA You must also file a return to obtain a refund of any income tax withheld, even if you do not meet any of the requirements specified above. Taxpayers Can Get Special Tax Credit The Earned Income Credit is a refundable tax credit available to certain working taxpayers who earned less than 510,000 in 1984, the Internal Revenue Service said. The credit will be paid to taxpayers who qualify even if it exceeds tax liability or the taxpayer owes no taxes. Some taxpayers could receive a credit of as much as 5500, according to the IRS. To be eligible for the Earned Income Credit, taxpayers must: 1. have both an Adjusted Gross Income and Earned Income (including those of the spouse, unless the taxpayer qualifies as an unmarried head of household) of less than 510,000; and 2. file as married filing jointly, head of household, or qualifying widow or widower; and 3. not have excluded any income earned in a foreign country or a U.S. possession, or claimed a deduc- - tion for a foreign housing amount; and 4. live in a home with a dependent child for the whole year. If the tax- payer qualifies, as a head of household because of an unmarried child, that child must live with the tax- payer, but does not have to be claimed as a dependent. Taxpayers may elect to receive their credit in one of two ways. If they are eligible, they can receive it when they file their return, or they may choose to have their employer include advance payments in their paychecks throughout the year, the IRS noted. . Additional information on the Earned Income Credit and advance payments is available in the free IRS Publication 596, Earned Income Credit. If you use a part of your home regularly and exclusively for business purposes, you may deduct a part of the operating and depreciation expenses on your home as an itemized deduction, the Internal Revenue says. If you are on outside salesperson or if your employer reimburses you for these expenses and you include the reimbursement in income, you may deduct the expenses as an adjustment to gross income. For additional information, taxpayers ran order the free IRS Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, using the handy order form in the tax For older Americans, a rapidly growing segment of the nations population, the tax laws ofTer a number of special tax benefits, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Single persons 65 or older do not have to file a federal income tax return if their income was less than 54,300. The limit for a married couple filing a joint return is 56,400 when only one spouse is 65 or older, and 57,400 if both spouses are 65 or over. For this purpose. persons are considered to be 65 on the day before their 65th birthday. Anyone 65 or older and filing a tax return is entitled to a double personal exemption of 52,000 for single persons and 54,000 for a mamed couple filing a joint return (both 65 or older). Taxpayers who have been out of work and collecting unemployment benefits may owe income tax on those benefits if total income for the year exceeds certain limits, the Internal Reveune Service said. Generally a single taxpayer will have taxable unemployment compensation if his or her total income is more than 512,000. Married taxpayers filing jointly will be taxed if the total income For more information on this subject, taxpayers can read the instructions in their tax return packages, or obtain a free copy of IRS Publication 905, Tax Information on Unemployment Compensation, by calling or writing the year-roun- charge. Another special benefit is the Credit Elderly and the Permanently and Totally Disabled. The credit can in some cases reduce taxes owed by as much as 5750 for single persons and 51.125 for married couples filing a joint return. Starting in 1984, individuals under 65 will be eligible for this credit only if they retire with total and permanent disability and have income from a public or private employer because of that disability. Senior citizens who are thinking about selling their personal residence should consider the 5125,000 exclusion of the gain on the sale of their home. An awareness of the tax consequence is essential before selling a personal residence at any age, but doubly so for those age 55 or older to whom this benefit applies. Taxpayers needing assistance with their returns can turn to Tax Counseling for the Elderly, an IRS program through which organizational volunteers provide free tax information and for the assistance to individuals age 60 and over.

The employers name and address, the period covered and the total amount of tips must also be in the report, which must be' signed and dated by the employee. If the employee keeps a daily tip record, it will be that much easier to prepare the monthly report, according to the IRS. Employers are responsible for withholding social security or railroad retirement tax and income tax, the IRS explained. And food and beverage establishments where tipping is customary and that normally employ more than 10 employees are required to file an annual report with the IRS. These reports will be used to determine whether employees have been accurately reporting tip income. Free IRS forms are available for maintaining a daily tip record and preparing monthly reports. Write or call the IRS and ask for Publication 1244 which contains the forms. Publication 331, Reporting Income from Tips, is also available without charge. All Tips Must Be Reported on U.S. Tax Returns Workers who receive tips must report this money as income on their tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service said. Those who receive less than $20 a month in tips must keep their own records and include the total amount of tip income received during the year on their Form 1040, 1040 A, or 1040EZ income tax return. Workers who earn $20 or more a month in tips while working for one employer must report the total amount of these tips each month to their employer by the 10th day of the following month. Some employers may require these written reports more than once a month. The monthly tip report must contain the employees name, address and so as wages, salaries, and tips. However, income earned by one spouse working for the other does not qualify; nor does such income as interest, dividends, pensions, annuities, IRA distributions, unemployment compensation, deferred compensation or nontaxable income. More complete information is contained in the tax forms instructions for Form 1040 and Form 1040A. A Special Tax Break for Working Couples Married couples who work are eligible for a special tax deduction worth as much as $3,000 on 1984 federal tax returns. This deduction may be claimed on either Form 1040A or Form 1040, the IRS said. The deduction is subtracted from gross income and is limited to the smaller of either 10 percent of the qualified earned income of the spouse, or 10 percent of up to $30,000, for a maximum deduction of $3,000. To take the deduction, both spouses must have earned income, such . . .

The primary proof for these business expenses starts with keeping timely entries of what was spent in a log, diary, journal, appointment book, or similar record. These entries must also include the date and location of the business travel or entertainment, along with who was seen, and the business purpose for incurring the expense, the IRS said. A receipt or similar supporting evidence is required for all expenses of $23 or more. According to IRS guidelines, all business expenses must be ordinary and necessary in the taxpayers line of work to be deductible. Reasonable local transportation expenses such as the cost of driving and maintaining an automobile while on business, excluding any commuting and personal mileage, can be deducted. For a business-relate- d trip outside the area of his or her main place of business, a taxpayer may deduct expenses such as food and lodging, said the IRS. Allowable entertainment deductions must either be directly related to, or associated with, the active pursuit of the taxpayers business. Business gifts that the taxpayer may deduct are generally limited to $25 for any one individual for the year. The burden of proof for all business expenses lies with the taxpayer, who must show that a bonafide business purpose exists.
