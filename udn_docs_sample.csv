A legacy of the WPA period is a permanent collection of 16 that hung until paintings recently in the Helper Civic Two of the pain- Auditorium. tings are by Fausett. Preservation work is being done of these paintings but they' again will be exhibited in the future. Burke is working on a project to locate and catalog all the art produced under the WPA project and to document the project. Artists in the Salt Lake area, who worked on the WPA art project included Paul Smith, Florence Ware, Barbara Moore, Dorothea Davis and others. The artists were paid $85 per month. Schools and other institutions were encouraged to buy the art work. Burke said that Miss Wares work could be purchased at that time for $2.50 per painting. The prices now paid for her work range from $500 to $2,000. Vivian Peacock Wetzel, who grew up in Price, talked about her recollections of the Depression era, when people, especialy in rural areas, developed their own talents to provide entertainment for the community. One of the first things I noted after moving to Salt Lake City in 1948 was that people there relied much more on commercial entertainment than we did here, she said. During the Depression years, and earlier, in Carbon County the schools, churches, clubs and civic organizations starting points were the for the and of plays production programs, she said. The schools produced several dramas a year and the Rotary Club sponsored one production a year in which people from the community particpated with students. The opera in produced was Carmen and earlier The Merchant 1936 Shakespeares of Venice. Harold Bithell, who should have been on Broadway and whose daughter later was on Broadway, members of the Bunnell family and many others were in these productions, she said. She also read poems written by her mother, Mabel Peacock, Bessie Gibson and other residents of this area during that time. Mrs. Wetzel also talked about her recollections of Lynn and Dean Fausett. Lynn returned to Utah after studying at the Art Students League in New York City but Dean preferred the green hills of Vermont, she said. Dean Fausett, who was much younger than Lynn, is still active as an artist. He paints by of portraits many famous people. During the Depression the movies, which have since been recognized as an art form, were our great escape, she said. also She described the 1984 fashions of the Depression era which were simple in style for featured but daytime glamourous evening gowns. She said that one ruffled evening gown worn by Joan Crawford in a movie which also featured Clark Gable was copied by a New York City department store. Hundreds of copies of this gown were sold. Wetzel received and masters Mrs. bachelors degrees from the University of Utah and a Ph.D. in education from Young Brigham She retired after children in retarded teaching the Salt Lake City school University. system. of black and white photographs of Consumers, a town no longer in existence, that were taken during the Depression era. Two photographers, Russell Lee and Dorothea Lange, who later became very famous, came to Utah, at different times, to take photographs. The photographs of Consumers, taken by Miss Lange, were to document a resettlement project, part of a government program to help miners build their own homes and to get land on which to plant gardens. It was a test project. Russell Lee did not come to Carbon County. The project apparently was not as succesful in this area as it was in agricultural parts of the . This is just one small section of the WPA mural in Price City's municipal building which was painted by Lynn Fausett during the Great Depression. The project was a means of providing work and conserving artists talents. state. Miss Lange spent only a few days photographing in Consumers Johnson said that Miss Lange was noted for photographing people, including some people of the dust bowl which became famous, but few people are shown in her photographs of Consumers. Dr. J. Eldon Dorman, who moved to Consumers only a few months after Miss Lange took her photographs, and who attended the meeting, said that the pictures, whose original prints are in the Library of Congress, depicted the worst side of Consumers. J. Grant Kilfoyle, program chairman, said future programs will include a meeting at the Helper Mining Museum; a presentation by Dr. J. Eldon Dorman, representing the Utah State Historical Society; the Castle Gate mine explosion; a walking tour of historic homes in Price, and a tour of Spring Canyon.

The two dancers have spent four weeks at the school. Lisa Roll and Lynn Koshland lead a gym class of girls at Carbon High School in a Roll and Koshland visited the school for a week in November and two weeks in December. They will finish up the residency today. Roll and Koshland worked with the students under the auspices of the Utah Arts Councils Artists in Education Program. This state program helps teachers expose students to many types of art disciplines by sharing the cost of bringing professional artists into the schools. The two have been teaching dance and choreography skills to the high School drill team and flag team members and also ' have been instructing the remaining boys and girls through physical education classes at the high school. Roll is an accomplished dancer who has performed extensively with the Tulsa Ballet, the Dallas Ballet and as a member of the Prairie Dance Theater, a modern dance company that toured as part of Arts Alliance the Program. She teaches the dynamic disciplines of movement, breath and feeling. A teacher for the Childrens Dance Theater in Salt Lake City, Roll also combines Mid-Americ- an traditional and creative movement techniques as choreographer for various dance companies. Koshland, a specialist in movement education, received her masters degree from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. She holds a bachelors degree in early childhood studies from the University of Utah. She has worked with students of all ages in movement exploration. Presently, she is a movement therapist at the Salt Lake Childrens Center, where she also teaches a conditioning class for the staff therapists. She also conducts special teacher workshops to help educators learn to relax and enjoy many types of movement. Roll says creative dance can be applied in any subject of learning and will help the students with creative decisionmaking through space, time and cooperative group efforts. Foundation analyzes unemployment compensation Is the surance in- unemployment ac- program complishing its goals and what should be the role of the program in the future? These were some of the questions asked the Foundation, by Utah private research organization, in its latest analysis of Utahs unemployment program. According to the study there has been growing concern about the program during recent years. Some critics have charged that the program has made unemployment too attractive for certain workers and firms. On the other hand, there are those who contend that the Open Daily Sunday 10-- 6 IK I him a program is too restrictive and does not serve a large group of the unemployed. Following are some of the major criticisms leveled against the program: 1. Overly generous benefits have reduced incentives to seek new employment and tend to prolong the unemployment problem. 2. Rules designed to limit benefits to those who are ready, able and willing to work are difficult to enforce. 3- .Because of cost and time considerations, employers often are discouraged from appealing the illegal granting of benefits. 4. High employment taxes have raised the cost of labor and led to greater unemployment. 5. Only about one-thi- all actually of rd unemployed persons receive unemployment benefits. 6. Availability encourages of benefits temporary unemployment because those laid off form a labor pool who can be used when needed. 7. Some individuals use unemployment benefits as a means of extending vacations and increasing leisure time. Utahs Department of Employment Security is aware of some of these problems and has placed increased emphasis on detecting fraud. According to the Foundation, a record number of fraud cases were processed in 1986. Most of these involved in dividuals who obtained unemployment benefits illegally while working or receiving other earnings. Approximately five percent of these cases were referred for criminal prosecution. Because of the concern about the program, the 1985 Congressional Budget Office report outlined a number of possible options for future consideration: 1. The waiting period before recipients would receive benefits could be extended. 2. The eligibility and enforcement requirements could be strengthened. 3. Job search instruction for the unemployed could be UIm Urn vlWW nWllwT 9-- Iius'l, VTAmericas Favorite Store I ADVERTISE!) POLICV 1 SAT., JAN. 10; ENDS MON., JAN. 12 SALE STARTS Sale Price.

A wonderful bargain for the $2.5 million it cost, the high school has given a quarter of a century of good service and still has about 20 years of useful life remaining if it is remodeled and updated, Crocco said. In 1985 replacement costs for the high school were estimated at $16 million.

Looking at employment by major industry group, Astin indicated the following developments: During 1986, mining employment dropped by 18 percent. This sector lost 1,700 jobs over the course of the year. Utahs 1986 average of 8,000 mining jobs ranks at the lowest level of the past 35 years. Lost copper mining jobs combined with a decline in energy-relate- d extraction positions to produce this drop. Construction suffered a 2,400 job, 7 percent loss in 1986, leaving the industry with 33,100 jobs. The completion of the first phase of the Intermountain Power Project caused much of this decline. In addition, the slowdown in nonresidential y building and in dwelling construction contributed to the loss. multi-famil- In 1986, employment in dropped 2 percent (2,000 positions) to register at 92,000 jobs.

On the other hand, a few manufacturing divisions added jobs. Transportation equipment manufacturing gained employment after experiencing layoffs early in the year.

Mayor Olsen told city coun-cilme- n at their Jan. meeting that Wright told him the preferred plan is to find someone interested in 8 recovering the 50 percent usable coal in the pile. Negotiations have been underway with several companies for some time. Leah Ann Schirle, water quality adminstrator, Southeastern Utah Association of Governments, said she was told that Norwest Resources Inc., a company hired by DOGM last summer to do core drilling on the pile, found that there was more good coal in the pile than formerly believed. Recovery could be done either by hauling the entire pile to a washing plant or by setting up a small mining operation on the site to try to separate the good coal from the waste materials, Schirle said. But she has been told that either process would be quite expensive, she said. If someone could be found to use the coal, only the remaining refuse would require disposal. The site being considered for disposal is on state land between the Spring Canyon and Consumer roads. Schirle said the coal pile is number two on the priority list of pollution problems on the Price River drainage. Number one is the problem surrounding Scofield Reservoir. Coal washing from the old pile into the Price River causes problems for fish and farmers, she said. The problems were particularly bad in the spring of 1983 when large amounts of water were released from Scofield Reservoir to avert flooding. Among the problems for farmers is toe fact that dark coal attracts and holds heat when it is spread over the land. For fish, coal can be life threatening because coal particles destroy protective mucous membranes. Culinary water quality is not affected by toe coal washing into the river because water for culinary use is taken out higher up toe stream. Coal piles along scenic waterways, such as the Price River, are also considered to be an eyesore by many people, she said. Present mining regulations would prohibit such piling of coal, she said. The coal apparently was believed to be of unusable quality when put there, she said, and has been there a long time. At first there were efforts to get Price River Coal Co. and then several government agencies to assume resonsibility for removal, she said. DOGM has assumed responsiblity and money has been appropriated for the project. ",28321259,1824784103093829632

There are a number of swales where water puddles. It cannot be used without work to take out some of the uneven places. Marra said that he has been told by CEU officials that the field should be higher in the middle and then tapered to the sides.

In a report released this week by fire chief David Barrett, the Price Fire Department answered 113 fire calls. Of those calls, 71 were within the city limits of Price and 39 were answered in the remainder of Carbon County. One call was answered in Hiawatha and two were answered in Wellington, according to the report. Fire losses in Price City amounted to $70,920 according to the report. The largest damage came from a fire at Road Specialists on July 18 which amounted to $20,000 in On-O- ff damage. A mobile home fire on Oct. 18 at South Carbon also caused damage. Nearly $350,000 in damage was done by fires in the county answered by the Price department. The largest fire in the county was Feb. 8 when the shops of Jensen Trucking on Ridge Road suffered $300,000 damage. A fire on March 1 at Johnson Heating in Carbonville caused $40,000 in 205 $20,000 damage. Three arson cases were investigated by the fire department in 1986, all of which were within Price City limits. The number of fire calls logged in 1986 exceeds the number of the previous three years, according to the report. The biggest cause of fires that required the fire department to respond were grass and rubbish fires that were deliberately set. The department was called to 35 such fires. Price firefighters spent over 50 hours in training during the year and received special training in arson detection, radio operations, ambulance equipment, vehicle extrication, burn treatment and braking on the fire trucks. mu ai.'w-'"" The department inspected 152 businesses for fire safety and 43 of those were found to have safety problems. Problems with fire extinguishers were the leading safety problems found, according to the report. Many in the community were reached by fire safety education provided by the department. With puppet shows and in- structional stop, and and children schools, elementary were provided along with assistance for Boy Scout merit badges. The Price Fire Department acquired the rescue truck from Carbon County in October and took over the operation of the truck. The first call that was answered by the rescue truck under the operation of the fire department was Oct. 23 when they were called to an automobile accident at the Hiawatha Junction. 1,460 adults in 81 scout groups and Demonstrations of use of fire extinguishers were presented to pre-schoo- reported people in the community.

But I am sure that it will come to that if people do not take their garbage away with them. He said the most serious problem for people who drink Scofield water is coming from human waste being left on the ice. But there is everything from human waste to food garbage, lots of beer cans, other cans, pieces of paper wrappings and cardboard packages, many things that people do not want to drink. What we want is for people to haul their garbage away, he said. There is no state agency equipped to take care of the problem for the people using the site. Palmer and the PRWID board of trustees strongly suggest that all trash materials be removed and disposed of properly in receptacles or taken home. This is a newly deVSloping problem because of the upsurge in popularity of ice fishing and changing times. from the Utah Officials Division of Wildlife Resources have expressed concern over The the pollution as well. bottom line is that if people are not going to be responsible for taking out their own trash, it will have to be closed for ice said John Livesay, fishing, division manager southeast region. the of Stavar.

On a positive note about the lake, fisheries manager Walt Donaldson indicated that there have been new parking areas on the east side of the reservoir created by the Utah Department of Transportation, relieving much of the parking pressure along the highway. Signs indicating heavy pressure along the road have also been put up. In the past, winter was a time when old fishermen talked, about their mighty catches and the big ones that got away during the summer. For the past several years Scofield has been one of the best places in the state for ice fishing and other forms of winter recreation such as riding three vehicles. and Many people are coming from other parts of the state. For many it is a great family outing through the use of mobile homes and campers. Some even pitch tents on the ice. The trustees of the water four-wheel- ed district said that it' is a great opportunity to have such a fine recreational site within easy access and they want to encourage its use to the fullest.
